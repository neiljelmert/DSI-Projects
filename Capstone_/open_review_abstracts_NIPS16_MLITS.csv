Similarity Mapping with Enhanced Siamese Network for Multi-Object Tracking,"Multi-object tracking has recently become an important area of computer vision, especially for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Despite growing attention, achieving high performance tracking is still challenging, with state-of-the-art systems resulting in high complexity with a large number of hyper parameters. In this paper, we focus on reducing overall system complexity and the number hyper parameters that need to be tuned to a specific environment. We introduce a novel tracking system based on similarity mapping by Enhanced Siamese Neural Network (ESNN), which accounts for both appearance and geometric information, and is trainable end-to-end.

End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist,"Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes, but it has not yet been successfully used for automotive applications. There has recently been a revival of interest in the topic, however, driven by the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn good representations of the environment. Motivated by Google DeepMind's successful demonstrations of learning for games from Breakout to Go, we will propose different methods for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular interest as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem as it has a strong interaction with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As this is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we will formulate two main categories of algorithms: 1) Discrete actions category, and 2) Continuous actions category. For the discrete actions category, we will deal with Deep Q-Network Algorithm (DQN) while for the continuous actions category, we will deal with Deep Deterministic Actor Critic Algorithm (DDAC). In addition to that, We will also discover the performance of these two categories on an open source car simulator for Racing called (TORCS) which stands for The Open Racing car Simulator. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction with other vehicles. Finally, we explain the effect of some restricted conditions, put on the car during the learning phase, on the convergence time for finishing its learning phase. "
Multi-Path Feedback Recurrent Neural Network for Scene Parsing,"	In this paper, we consider the scene  parsing problem and propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{F}eedback recurrent neural network (MPF-RNN) for parsing scene images. MPF-RNN can  enhance the capability of RNNs in modeling long-range context information at multiple levels and better distinguish pixels that are easy to confuse. Different from feedforward CNNs and RNNs with only single feedback, MPF-RNN propagates  the contextual features learned at top layer through weighted recurrent connections to \emph{multiple} bottom layers to help them learn better features with such ``hindsight''. For better training MPF-RNN, we propose a new  strategy that considers accumulative loss  at multiple recurrent steps  to improve performance of the MPF-RNN on parsing  small objects. With these two novel components, MPF-RNN has achieved significant improvement over strong baselines (VGG16 and Res101) on five challenging scene parsing benchmarks, including traditional SiftFlow, Barcelona, CamVid, Stanford Background as well as the recently released large-scale ADE20K."
Efficient decomposition method for the stochastic optimization of public transport schedules,"We propose a new method to optimize public transport schedules by minimizing the waiting time during transfers. Using ticket validation
data to construct a realistic scenario-based model of the waiting times, our goal is to design shifts of the current schedules that reduce the overall expected waiting time. We propose a parallel local search heuristic that exploits the structure of the problem to efficiently explore a large number of possible schedules. Compared to previous approaches, our algorithm should allow to both treat more transfers (bigger cities) and more scenarios (ensuring a better generalization). We provide promising preliminary results on transit data collected from Nancy, France."
Speeding up Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"Deep learning has considerably improved semantic image segmentation. However,
its high accuracy is traded against larger computational costs which makes it unsuit-
able for embedded devices in self-driving cars. We propose a novel deep network
architecture for image segmentation that keeps the high accuracy while being
efficient enough for embedded devices. The architecture consists of ELU activation
functions, a SqueezeNet-like encoder, followed by parallel dilated convolutions,
and a decoder with SharpMask-like refinement modules. On the Cityscapes dataset,
the new network achieves higher segmentation accuracy than other networks that
are tailored to embedded devices. Simultaneously the frame-rate is still sufficiently
high for the deployment in autonomous vehicles."
Mapping Occupancy of Dynamic Environments using Big Data Gaussian Process Classification,"Understanding the dynamics of urban environments is crucial for path planning and safe navigation. However, the dynamics might be extremely complex making
mapping a non-trivial problem. Within the methods available for learning dynamic environments, Dynamic Gaussian process occupancy maps (DGPOM) are attractive
because they can produce spatially-continuous occupancy maps taking into account neighborhood information, and provide probabilistic estimates, naturally inferring
the uncertainty of predictions. Despite these properties, they are extremely slow, especially in dynamic mapping where the parameters of the map have to be updated
as new data arrive from range sensors such as LiDARs. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in stochastic variational inference (SVI) to quickly learn
dynamic areas in an online fashion. Further, we propose an information-driven technique to “intelligently” select inducing points required for SVI without relying
on any object tracker or velocity information. Our experiments with both simulation and real robot data on road intersections show a significant improvement in speed while maintaining a comparable or better accuracy as DGPOM."
Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation of Bike Sharing System Temporal Network,"In recent years, bike sharing systems have become very popular in many major cities. Thanks to the data they generate, their activity can be tracked down, giving an overall view of how human activities are spread over time and space. We propose in the present article a novel method to extract mobility patterns that occur in such large-scale transportation systems. The trips made by the users are first represented as flows between the different stations of the system, describing a network whose structure evolves over time. A decomposition technique is then proposed using non-negative matrix factorisation, to express the resulting temporal networks as a mixture of sub-networks, each of them characterising the different behaviours of users over time and space. This method is applied on the Lyon's bike sharing system, and it is emphasised that key spatio-temporal elements of urban activity are retrieved, capturing known phenomena such as commuting. This approach could be easily extended to large-scale transportation systems exhibiting a network structure, paving the way to an unsupervised modelling of mobility patterns."
Increasing the Stability of CNNs using a Denoising Layer Regularized by Local Lipschitz Constant,"Recent studies have revealed that ConvNets are sensitive to small perturbations in the input. This can cause fatal consequences in smart cars because of instability of the road understanding module. In this paper, we propose an objective function regularized by the local Lipschitz constant and train a layer for restoring images. Our experiments on the GTSRB and the Caltech-Pedestrian datasets show that our modular approach not only increases the accuracy of the classification ConvNets on the clean datasets but it also increases the stability of the ConvNets against noise. Comparing our method with similar approaches shows that it produces more stable ConvNets while it is computationally similar or more efficient than these methods."
