Paying More Attention to Attention: Improving the Performance of Convolutional Neural Networks via Attention Transfer,"Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience.
Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network. To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural network architectures."
Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding,"In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors and reconstructions are evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance). To use these codes for discriminative classification, we describe a model we term Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC) in which the hypothesized class label introduces a learned linear bias into the coding step. We evaluate and visualize performance of stacking this encoder to make a deep layered model for image classification."
Revisiting Denoising Auto-Encoders,"Denoising auto-encoders (DAE)s were proposed as a simple yet powerful way to obtain representations in an unsupervised manner by learning a map that approximates the clean inputs from their corrupted versions. However, the original objective function proposed for DAEs does not guarantee that denoising happens only at the encoding stages. We argue that a better representation can be obtained if the encoder is forced to carry out most of the denoising effort. Here, we propose a simple modification to the DAE's objective function that accomplishes the above goal. "
End-to-End Learnable Histogram Filters,"Problem-specific algorithms and generic machine learning approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, trading-off data efficiency and generality. To find the right balance between these, we propose to use problem-specific information encoded in algorithms together with the ability to learn details about the problem-instance from data. We demonstrate this approach in the context of state estimation in robotics, where we propose end-to-end learnable histogram filters---a differentiable implementation of histogram filters that encodes the structure of recursive state estimation using prediction and measurement update but allows the specific models to be learned end-to-end, i.e. in such a way that they optimize the performance of the filter, using either supervised or unsupervised learning."
Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Trust Region Fitted Q-Iteration,"Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. The visual servoing problem comes up in robotic tasks that range from target following for an aerial vehicle to robotic manipulation to spacecraft docking. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, so as to be easy and quick to adapt to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use reinforcement learning to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that our method can learn an effective visual servo using just tens of trajectories. We evaluate our method on a complex synthetic car following benchmark, and demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional pixel-based approach."
Rotation Plane Doubly Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) applied to long sequences suffer from the well known vanishing and exploding gradients problem.  The recently proposed Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Network (uRNN) alleviates the exploding gradient problem and can learn very long dependencies, but its nonlinearities make it still affected by the vanishing gradient problem and so learning can break down for extremely long dependencies. We propose a new RNN transition architecture where the hidden state is updated multiplicatively by a time invariant orthogonal transformation followed by an input modulated orthogonal transformation. There are no additive interactions and so our architecture exactly preserves forward hid-den state activation norm and backwards gradient norm for all time steps, and is provably not affected by vanishing or exploding gradients.  We propose using the rotation plane parameterization to represent the orthogonal matrices. We validate our model on a simplified memory copy task and see that our model can learn dependencies as long as 5,000 timesteps."
Near-Data Processing for Machine Learning,"In computer architecture, near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting the memory or the storage with processing power so that it can process the data stored therein. By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML."
Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, many of the deep RL algorithms still employ naive exploration strategies, and they have been shown to perform poorly in tasks with sparse rewards, and/or with long horizons. To tackle these challenges, there are two common approaches. The first approach is to design a hierarchy over the actions, which would require domain-specific knowledge and careful hand-engineering. A different line of work utilizes domain-agnostic intrinsic rewards to guide exploration, which has been shown to be effective in tasks with sparse rewards. However, it is unclear how the knowledge of solving a task can be utilized for other tasks, leading to a high sample complexity overall for the entire collection of tasks. In this paper, we propose a general framework for learning useful skills in a pre-training environment, which can then be utilized in downstream tasks by training a high-level policy over these skills. To learn these skills, we use stochastic neural networks (SNNs) combined with an intrinsic reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and, when trained on downstream tasks, can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across all these tasks.

Towards an automatic Turing test: Learning to evaluate dialogue responses,"Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem.
Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, rendering it a strong basis for dialogue response evaluation."
Investigating Recurrence and Eligibility Traces in Deep Q-Networks,"Eligibility traces in reinforcement learning are used as a bias-variance trade-off and can often speed up training time by propagating knowledge back over time-steps in a single update. We investigate the use of eligibility traces in combination with recurrent networks in the Atari domain.  We illustrate the benefits of both recurrent nets and eligibility traces in some Atari games, and highlight also the importance of the optimization used in the training."
Exploring the Application of Deep Learning for Supervised Learning Problems,"One of the main difficulties in applying deep neural nets (DNNs) to new domains is the need to explore multiple architectures in order to discover ones that perform well. We analyze a large set of DNNs across multiple domains and derive insights regarding their effectiveness. We also analyze the characteristics of various DNNs and the general effect they may have on performance. Finally, we explore the application of meta-learning to the problem of architecture ranking. We demonstrate that by using topological features and modeling the changes in its weights, biases and activation functions layers of the initial training steps, we are able to rank architectures based on their predicted performance. We consider this work to be a first step in the important and challenging direction of exploring the space of different neural network architectures.

Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion,"Empirically, neural networks that attempt to learn programs from data have exhibited poor generalizability. Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a threshold level of input complexity. In order to address these issues, we suggest augmenting neural architectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on two tasks, addition and sorting, and demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with smaller amounts of training data. By dividing the problem into smaller pieces and drastically reducing the domain of each neural network component, this approach also makes it tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system’s behavior. Our experience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn program semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion."
An Empirical Analysis of Deep Network Loss Surfaces,"The training of deep neural networks is a high-dimension optimization problem with respect to the loss function of a model. Unfortunately, these functions are of high dimension and non-convex and hence difficult to characterize. In this paper, we empirically investigate the geometry of the loss functions for state-of-the-art networks with multiple stochastic optimization methods. We do this through several experiments that are visualized on polygons to understand how and when these stochastic optimization methods find minima."
Nonparametric Neural Networks,"Determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task is a challenging problem that is often addressed through a combination of expert tuning, random search or black-box bayesian optimization. These methods have two drawbacks: (A) They are expensive because training has to be started anew for each network size considered and (B) They cannot seize upon performance improvements that may arise by altering the network architecture during a single training cycle. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the network size during training so as to find a good architecture automatically while possibly squeezing additional performance from that architecture. We do this by continuously adding new units to the network during training while removing the least useful units via an $\ell_2$ penalty. We train the network with a novel algorithm, which we term ``Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent'' or {\it AdaRad}."
Distributed Second-Order Optimization using Kronecker-Factored Approximations,"As more computational resources become available, machine learning researchers train ever larger neural networks on millions of data points using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Although SGD scales well in terms of both the size of dataset and the number of parameters of the model, it has rapidly diminishing returns as parallel computing resources increase.  Second-order optimization methods have an affinity for well-estimated gradients and large mini-batches, and can therefore benefit much more from parallel computation in principle.   Unfortunately,  they often employ severe approximations to the curvature matrix in order to scale to large models with millions of parameters, limiting their effectiveness in practice versus well-tuned SGD with momentum.  The recently proposed K-FAC method(Martens and Grosse, 2015) uses a stronger and more sophisticated curvature approximation, and has been shown to make much more per-iteration progress than SGD, while only introducing a modest overhead.  In this paper, we develop a version of K-FAC that distributes the computation of gradients and additional quantities required by K-FAC across multiple machines, thereby taking advantage of method’s superior scaling to large mini-batches and mitigating its additional overheads. We provide a Tensorflow implementation of our approach which is easy to use and can be applied to many existing codebases without modification.  Additionally, we develop several algorithmic enhancements to K-FAC which can improve its computational performance for very large models. Finally, we show that our distributed K-FAC method speeds up training of various state-of-the-art ImageNet classification models by a factor of two compared to Batch Normalization(Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)."
Gated Multimodal Units for Information Fusion,"This paper presents a novel model for multimodal learning based on gated neural networks. The Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) model is intended to be used as an internal unit in a neural network architecture whose purpose is to find an intermediate representation based on a combination of data from different modalities. The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of the unit using multiplicative gates. It was evaluated on a multilabel scenario for genre classification of movies using the plot and the poster. The model improves the macro f-score performance of single-modality models by 30% and 4% with respect to visual and textual information respectively. Along with this work, the MM-IMDb dataset will be released which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest publicly available multimodal dataset for genre prediction on movies."
Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets,"The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts towards reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting the accuracy. However, using weights pruning to generate sparse CNNs mostly reduces parameters from the fully connected layers and may not significantly reduce the computation costs with irregular sparsity. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy.  By removing whole filters in the network, together with their connecting feature maps, the computational costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to weights pruning, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns.  Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by upto 38% while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.  "
Learning to Generate Samples from Noise through Infusion Training,"In this work, we investigate a novel training procedure to learn a generative model as the transition operator of a Markov chain, such that, when applied repeatedly on an unstructured random noise sample, it will denoise it into a sample that matches the target distribution from the training set. The novel training procedure to learn this progressive denoising operation involves sampling from a slightly different chain than the model chain used for generation in the absence of a denoising target. In the training chain we infuse information from the training target example that we would like the chains to reach with a high probability. The thus learned transition operator is able to produce quality and varied samples in a small number of steps. Experiments show competitive results compared to the samples generated with a basic Generative Adversarial Net. "
Unsupervised Learning Using Generative Adversarial Training And Clustering,"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach that makes use of two components; a deep hierarchical feature extractor, and a more traditional clustering algorithm. We train the feature extractor in a purely unsupervised manner using generative adversarial training and, in the process, study the strengths of learning using a generative model as an adversary. We also show that adversarial training as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is not sufficient to automatically group data into categorical clusters. Instead, we use a more traditional grouping algorithm, k-means	 clustering, to cluster the features learned using adversarial training. We experiment on three well-known datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. The experiments show that the proposed approach performs similarly to supervised learning approaches, and, might even be better in situations with small amounts of labeled training data and large amounts of unlabeled data."
#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once.
Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. 

In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results.

Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration."
FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs. By restricting to local connections and sharing local weights among different locations, CNNs greatly reduce the number of parameters, leading to ease of training and improved generalization capabilities. In this paper, we consider the definition of appropriate local neighborhoods in CNN.We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies the traditional square filter used in CNN for analyzing naturalimages. The analysis also provides a principle for designing customized filter shapes for application domains that do not resemble natural images. We propose an approach that automatically designs multiple layers of different customized filter shapes by repeatedly solving lasso problems. It is applied to customize the filter shape for both bioacoustic applications and gene sequence analysis applications. In those domains with small sample sizes we demonstrate that the customized filters achieve superior classification accuracy, improved convergence behavior in training and reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters."
Normalizing the Normalizers: Comparing and Extending Network Normalization Schemes,"Normalization techniques have only recently begun to be exploited in supervised learning tasks. Batch normalization exploits mini-batch statistics to normalize the activations. This was shown to speed up training and result in better models. However its success has been very limited when dealing with recurrent neural networks. On the other hand, layer normalization normalizes the activations across all activities within a layer. This was shown to work  well in the recurrent setting. In this paper we propose a unified view of  normalization techniques, as forms of divisive normalization, which includes layer and batch normalization as special cases. Our second contribution is the finding that a small modification to these normalization schemes, in conjunction with a sparse regularizer on the activations, leads to significant benefits over standard normalization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified divisive normalization framework  in the context of convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural networks, showing  improvements over baselines in image classification, language modeling as well as super-resolution.  "
Using the Output Embedding to Improve Language Models,"We study the topmost weight matrix of neural network language models. We show that this matrix constitutes a valid word embedding. When training language models, we recommend tying the input embedding and this output embedding. We analyze the resulting update rules and show that the tied embedding evolves in a more similar way to the output embedding than to the input embedding in the untied model. We also offer a new method of regularizing the output embedding. Our methods lead to a significant reduction in perplexity, as we are able to show on a variety of neural network language models. "
Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cells,"Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks."
Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning,"A recent approach to few-shot classification called matching networks has demonstrated the benefits of coupling metric learning with a training procedure that mimics test. This approach relies on a complicated fine-tuning procedure and an attention scheme that forms a distribution over all points in the support set, scaling poorly with its size. We propose a more streamlined approach, prototypical networks, that learns a metric space in which few-shot classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class, rather than individual points. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art one-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable with the size of the support set. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach on the Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets. We further demonstrate that a similar idea can be used for zero-shot learning, where each class is described by a set of attributes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD bird dataset."
Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching,"We propose an augmented training procedure for generative adversarial networks designed to address shortcomings of the original by directing the generator towards probable configurations of abstract discriminator features. We estimate and track the distribution of these features, as computed from data, with a denoising auto-encoder, and use it to propose high-level targets for the generator. We combine this new loss with the original and evaluate the hybrid criterion on the task of unsupervised image synthesis from datasets comprising a diverse set of visual categories, noting a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the ``objectness'' of the resulting samples."
On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"It is well known that it is challenging to train deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies. The vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during backpropagation and can therefore be a desirable property; however, we find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively affect the speed of convergence and model performance. This paper explores the issues of optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability using a variety of different methods for encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. In particular we propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we we can bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation."
Efficient Vector Representation for Documents through Corruption,"We present an efficient document representation learning framework, Document Vector through Corruption (Doc2VecC). Doc2VecC represents each document as a simple average of word embeddings. It ensures a representation generated as such captures the semantic meanings of the document during learning. A corruption model is included, which introduces a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common and non-discriminative ones to be close to 0. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms, and demonstrate that the simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in terms of expressiveness of the learned document representation for both sentiment analysis and document classification. Doc2VecC can be trained very efficiently. At the same time, it significantly improves testing efficiency."
Deep Neural Networks and the Tree of Life,"In Evolutionary Biology, species close in the tree of evolution are identified by similar visual features. In computer vision, deep neural networks perform image classification by learning to identify similar visual features. This leads to an interesting question: is it possible to leverage the advantage of deep networks to construct a tree of life? In this paper, we make the first attempt at building the phylogenetic tree diagram by leveraging the high-level features learned by deep neural networks. Our method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, then their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high. Based on the deep representation of convolutional neural networks trained for image classification, we build a tree of life for species in the image categories of ImageNet. Further, for species not in the ImageNet categories that are visually similar to some category, the cosine similarity of their activation vectors in the same layer should be high. By applying the inner product similarity of the activation vectors at the last fully connected layer for different species, we can roughly build their tree of life. Our work provides a new perspective to the deep representation and sheds light on possible novel applications of deep representation to other areas like Bioinformatics.
"
Generative Adversarial Parallelization,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most studied frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation. They have also been shown to be capable of generating convincing examples in limited domains, such as low-resolution images. However, they still prove difficult to train in practice and tend to ignore modes of the data generating distribution. Quantitatively capturing effects such as mode coverage and more generally the quality of the generative model still remain elusive. We propose Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP), a framework in which many GANs or their variants are trained simultaneously, exchanging their discriminators. This eliminates the tight coupling between a generator and discriminator, leading to improved convergence and improved coverage of modes. We also propose an improved variant of the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Metric and show how it can score individual GANs or their collections under the GAP model."
Layered Convolutional Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding Itemsets,"Itemset mining is one of the most primitive and extensively studied areas of data
mining. This area got a lot of attention from research and industry communities
to extract the most frequent and compact representation of transactional data to
better understand the business insights. Recently sparse dictionary learning was
successfully deployed to different domains, e.g., computer vision, speech recognition
but unfortunately never used for discrete data, particularly itemset data.
This paper combines the best of both worlds and studies a sparse-representation
method for itemset data. Given a database of itemsets, we construct a set of basis
(i.e., itemsets) such that the discovered basis set effectively compresses the
database under a user given sparse representation constraint. We formulate optimization
problem for sparse representing itemsets and show the discrete nature of
itemset makes it NP-hard. An efficient approximation algorithm greedily solves
max set cover to reduce overall compression loss. Convolutional dictionary learning
based approach is used to find statistically dependent patterns in a hierarchical
fashion. Our extensive empirical validation, on seven real-world datasets, shows
that sparse-coding enhances pattern interpretability and also the performance of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)."
End-to-end Optimized Image Compression,"We describe an image compression system, consisting of a nonlinear encoding transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear decoding transformation. Like many deep neural network architectures, the transforms consist of layers of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions, but we use a joint nonlinearity that implements a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the system for rate–distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. The relaxed optimization problem resembles that of variational autoencoders, except that it must operate at any point along the rate–distortion curve, whereas the optimization of generative models aims only to minimize entropy of the data under the model. Across an independent database of test images, we find that the optimized coder exhibits significantly better rate–distortion performance than the standard JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression systems, as well as a dramatic improvement in visual quality of compressed images."
Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,"People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ``analogy making,'' or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven."
b-GAN: Unified Framework of Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. They are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new unified perspective toward understanding GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained from the density ratio estimation research, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful. "
Higher Order Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this paper, we study novel neural network structures to better model long term dependency in sequential data. 
We propose to use more memory units to keep track of more preceding states in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are all recurrently fed to the hidden layers as feedback through different weighted paths. By extending the popular
recurrent structure in RNNs, we provide the models with better short-term memory mechanism to learn long term dependency in sequences. Analogous to digital filters in signal processing, we call these structures as higher order RNNs (HORNNs). Similar to RNNs, HORNNs can also be learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets, namely the Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8. Experimental results have shown that the proposed HORNNs yield the state-of-the-art performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the regular RNNs as well as the popular LSTMs. "
Generative Adversarial Networks as Variational Training of Energy Based Models,"In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the model density $p(\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution $q(\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\mathbf{x})$, $q(\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions."
Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects,"We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.

Introducing Active Learning for CNN under the light of Variational Inference,"A joint effort into the deep learning community consists in optimizing deep neural
networks so to increase their depth and hence their capacity of representation.
One of the first intuitive optimization to achieve such a goal consists in scaling
the size of the training database accordingly. Indeed a major intuition lies in
the fact that network’s depth and size of the training set are strongly correlated.
Despite this idea that deep networks need to be fed with more data to achieve
better accuracy, recent works tend to show that deep learning may be handled
with smaller dataset as long as the training samples are carefully well designed
(let us mention for instance curriculum learning). In this context we introduce a
scalable and efficient active learning method that can be applied to most neural
networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first of the kind to design an active learning selection
scheme based on a variational inference for neural networks. Recent works about
the approximation of the Fisher matrix for deep neural networks, especially CNN,
make our criterion perfectly suitable to handle the scalability of deep architectures.
We describe the steps that drive us to our Fisher based criterion and evaluate its
consistency by checking the accuracy obtained by successive active learning step
on two benchmark datasets MNIST and USPS. We also demonstrate its scalability
towards increasing query size."
An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views,"Finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential both in exploratory analysis and as pre-processing for predictive tasks. A prominent approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of neighbor retrieval between multiple views. We optimize mappings for each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, measures dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information retrieval quality. In experiments the proposed method outperforms alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views."
Character-aware Attention Residual Network for Sentence Representation,"Text classification in general is a well studied area. However, classifying short and noisy text remains challenging. Feature sparsity is a major issue. The quality of document representation here has a great impact on the classification accuracy. Existing methods represent text using bag-of-word model, with TFIDF or other weighting schemes. Recently word embedding and even document embedding are proposed to represent text. The purpose is to capture features at both word level and sentence level. However, the character level information are usually ignored. In this paper, we take word morphology and word semantic meaning into consideration, which are represented by character-aware embedding and word distributed embedding. By concatenating both character-level and word distributed embedding together and arranging words in order, a sentence representation matrix could be obtained. To overcome data sparsity problem of short text, sentence representation vector is then derived based on different views from sentence representation matrix. The various views contributes to the construction of an enriched sentence embedding. We employ a residual network on the sentence embedding to get a consistent and refined sentence representation. Evaluated on a few short text datasets, our model outperforms state-of-the-art models."
Attentive Recurrent Comparators,"Models that have the capacity of recognizing the subtle similarities or differences among a set of samples are crucial in many areas of Machine Learning. We present a novel neural model built with attention and recurrence that learns to compare the characteristics of set of objects. Our basic model outperforms strong baselines based on Deep ConvNets in many challenging visual tasks. We tested the generalization capacity of this model by using it for one shot classification on the Omniglot dataset, where it showed comparable results with other methods."
CAN AI GENERATE LOVE ADVICE?: TOWARD NEURAL ANSWER GENERATION FOR NON-FACTOID QUESTIONS,"
Deep learning methods that extract answers for non-factoid questions from QA sites are seen as critical since they can assist users in reaching their next decisions through conversations with AI systems. The current methods, however, have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context (e.g. the word “relationship” has quite different meanings in the categories of Love advice and other categories). As a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2) The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions (e.g. categories assigned to questions) into word embeddings while also computing them regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2) Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the sentences often used to form answers (e.g. sentences representing conclusions or those supplementing the conclusions). It then simultaneously learns the optimum combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations using datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete goo, indicate that our model achieves 20 % higher accuracy in answer creation than the strong baselines. Our model is practical and has already been applied to the love advice service in Oshiete goo."
Boosted Generative Models,"We propose a new approach for using boosting to create an ensemble of generative models, where models are trained in sequence to correct earlier mistakes. Our algorithm can leverage  many existing base learners, including recent latent variable models. Further, our approach allows the ensemble to leverage discriminative models trained to distinguish real from synthetic data during sample generation. We show theoretical conditions under which incorporating a new model to the ensemble will improve the fit and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of boosting on density estimation, sample generation, and unsupervised feature learning on real and synthetic datasets."
Adversarial examples for generative models,"Deep learning architectures have been shown to be severely affected by adversarial examples. Previous work has focused mostly on the application of adversarial examples to various classification tasks. Deep generative models have recently become very popular due to their great ability to model input data distributions. In this paper, we study the effect of adversarial examples on generative models such as the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the VAE-GAN. We design a way to attack both the VAE and VAE-GAN and as a result, our adversarial examples can make the generative models incorrectly reconstruct input images, such that the reconstructions more closely resemble the instances of incorrect classes. All this shows that adversarial examples are a general phenomenon for neural networks and that generative models can also be easily attacked."
What does it take to generate natural textures?,"Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning. Many approaches, e.g. for state-of-the-art artistic style transfer or natural texture synthesis, rely on the statistics of hierarchical representations in supervisedly trained deep neural networks. It is, however, unclear what aspects of this feature representation are crucial for natural image generation: is it the depth, the pooling or the training of the features on natural images? We here address this question for the task of natural texture synthesis and show that none of the above aspects are indispensable. Instead, we demonstrate that natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer, no pooling and random filters."
Towards Information-Seeking Agents,"We develop a general problem setting for training and testing the ability of agents to gather information efficiently. Specifically, we present a collection of tasks in which success requires searching through a partially-observed environment, for fragments of information which can be pieced together to accomplish various goals. We combine deep architectures with techniques from reinforcement learning to develop agents that solve our tasks. We shape the behavior of these agents by combining extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. We empirically demonstrate that these agents learn to search actively and intelligently for new information to reduce their uncertainty, and to exploit information they have already acquired."
Emergence of foveal image sampling from learning to attend in visual scenes,"We describe a neural attention model with a learnable retinal sampling lattice. The model is trained on a visual search task requiring the classification of an object embedded in a visual scene amidst background distractors using the smallest number of fixations. We explore the tiling properties that emerge in the model's retinal sampling lattice after training. Specifically, we show that this lattice resembles the eccentricity dependent sampling lattice of the primate retina, with a high resolution region in the fovea surrounded by a low resolution periphery. Furthermore, we find conditions where these emergent properties are amplified or eliminated providing clues to their function."
Multi-label learning with the RNNs for Fashion Search,"We build a large-scale visual search system which finds similar product images given a fashion item. Defining similarity among arbitrary fashion-products is still remains a challenging problem, even there is no exact ground-truth. To resolve this problem, we define more than 90 fashion-related attributes, and combination of these attributes can represent thousands of unique fashion-styles. We then introduce to use the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) recognising multi fashion-attributes with the end-to-end manner. To build our system at scale, these fashion-attributes are again used to build an inverted indexing scheme. In addition to these fashion-attributes for semantic similarity, we extract colour and appearance features in a region-of-interest (ROI) of a fashion item for visual similarity. By sharing our approach, we expect active discussion on that how to apply current deep learning researches into the e-commerce industry."
Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis,"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) computes maximally-correlated 
linear projections of two modalities. We propose Differentiable CCA, a 
formulation of CCA that can be cast as a layer within a multi-view 
neural network. Unlike Deep CCA, an earlier extension of CCA to 
nonlinear projections, our formulation enables gradient flow through the 
computation of the CCA projection matrices, and free choice of the final 
optimization target. We show the effectiveness of this approach in 
cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text 
datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with 
freely-learned projections. We assume that Differentiable CCA could be a 
useful building block for many multi-modality tasks."
An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax,"A framework is presented for unsupervised learning of representations based on infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. We use an asymptotic approximation to the Shannon's mutual information for a large neural population to demonstrate that a good initial approximation to the global information-theoretic optimum can be obtained by a hierarchical infomax method. From the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient descent of the final objective function is proposed to learn representations from the input datasets, allowing complete, overcomplete, or undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from image datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of unsupervised representation learning."
PixelCNN++: A PixelCNN Implementation with Discretized Logistic Mixture Likelihood and Other Modifications,"PixelCNNs are a recently proposed class of powerful generative models with tractable likelihood. Here we discuss our implementation of PixelCNNs which we make available at https://github.com/openai/pixel-cnn. Our implementation contains a number of modifications to the original model that both simplify its structure and improve its performance. 1) We use a discretized logistic mixture likelihood on the pixels, rather than a 256-way softmax, which we find to speed up training. 2) We condition on whole pixels, rather than R/G/B sub-pixels, simplifying the model structure. 3) We use downsampling to efficiently capture structure at multiple resolutions. 4) We introduce additional short-cut connections to further speed up optimization. 5) We regularize the model using dropout. Finally, we present state-of-the-art log likelihood results on CIFAR-10 to demonstrate the usefulness of these modifications."
Generating Long and Diverse Responses with Neural Conversation Models,"Building general-purpose conversation agents is a very challenging task, but necessary on the road toward intelligent agents that can interact with humans in natural language. Neural conversation models -- purely data-driven systems trained end-to-end on dialogue corpora -- have shown great promise recently, yet they often produce short and generic responses. This work presents new training and decoding methods that improve the quality, coherence, and diversity of long responses generated using sequence-to-sequence models. Our approach adds self-attention to the decoder to maintain coherence in longer responses, and we propose a practical approach, called the glimpse-model, for scaling to large datasets. We introduce a stochastic beam-search algorithm with segment-by-segment reranking which lets us inject diversity earlier in the generation process. We trained on a combined data set of over 2.3B conversation messages mined from the web. In human evaluation studies, our method produces longer responses overall, with a higher proportion rated as acceptable and excellent as length increases, compared to baseline sequence-to-sequence models with explicit length-promotion. A back-off strategy produces better responses overall, in the full spectrum of lengths."
Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes,"Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes. We propose a new method to better understand the roles and dynamics of the intermediate layers. This has direct consequences on the design of such models and it enables the expert to be able to justify certain heuristics (such as adding auxiliary losses in middle layers). Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as ``probes'', where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple steps of training. We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better intuition about models and to diagnose potential problems."
Improving Invariance and Equivariance Properties of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn highly discriminative representations from data, but how robust and structured are these representations? How does the data shape the internal network representation? We shed light on these questions by empirically measuring the invariance and equivariance properties of a large number of CNNs trained with various types of input transformations. We find that CNNs learn invariance wrt all 9 tested transformation types and that invariance extends to transformations outside the training range. We also measure the distance between CNN representations and show that similar input transformations lead to more similar internal representations. Transforms can be grouped by the way they affect the learned representation. Additionally, we also propose a loss function that aims to improve CNN equivariance."
TreNet: Hybrid Neural Networks for Learning the Local Trend in Time Series,"Local trends of time series characterize the intermediate upward and downward patterns of time series. Learning and forecasting the local trend in time series data play an important role in many real applications, ranging from investing in the stock market, resource allocation in data centers and load schedule in smart grid. Inspired by the recent successes of neural networks, in this paper we propose TreNet, a novel end-to-end hybrid neural network that predicts the local trend of time series based on local and global contextual features. TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering long-range dependencies existing in the sequence of historical local trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency. Furthermore, for predicting the local trend, a feature fusion layer is designed in TreNet to learn joint representation from the features captured by CNN and LSTM. Our proposed TreNet demonstrates its effectiveness by outperforming conventional CNN, LSTM, HMM method and various kernel based baselines on real datasets."
Intelligible Language Modeling with Input Switched Affine Networks,"The computational mechanisms by which nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their goals remains an open question.  There exist many problem domains where intelligibility of the network model is crucial for deployment. Here we introduce a recurrent architecture composed of input-switched affine transformations, in other words an RNN without any nonlinearity and with one set of weights per input.
We show that this architecture achieves near identical performance to traditional architectures on language modeling of Wikipedia text, for the same number of model parameters. 
It can obtain this performance with the potential for computational speedup compared to existing methods, by precomputing the composed affine transformations corresponding to longer input sequences. 
As our architecture is affine, we are able to understand the mechanisms by which it functions using linear methods. For example, we show how the network linearly combines contributions from the past to make predictions at the current time step. We show how representations for words can be combined in order to understand how context is transferred across word boundaries. Finally, we demonstrate how the system can be executed and analyzed in arbitrary bases to aid understanding."
Mode Regularized Generative Adversarial Networks,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a
variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss
modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular
functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which
can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction,
towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.
We introduce several ways of regularizing the objective, which can dramatically
stabilize the training of GAN models. We also show that our regularizers can help
the fair distribution of probability mass across the modes of the data generating
distribution during the early phases of training, thus providing a unified solution
to the missing modes problem."
Sequence generation with a physiologically plausible model of handwriting and Recurrent Mixture Density Networks,"The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of using a physiological plausible model of handwriting as a feature representation for sequence generation with recurrent mixture density networks. We build on recent results in handwriting prediction developed by Graves (2013), and we focus on generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms. Rather than model raw sequence data, we first preprocess and reconstruct the input training data with a concise representation given by a motor plan (in the form of a coarse sequence of `ballistic' targets) and corresponding dynamic parameters (which define the velocity and curvature of the pen-tip trajectory). This representation provides a number of advantages, such as enabling the system to learn from very few examples by introducing artificial variability in the training data, and mixing of visual and dynamic qualities learned from different datasets."
Highway and Residual Networks learn Unrolled Iterative Estimation,"The past year saw the introduction of new architectures such as Highway networks and Residual networks which, for the first time, enabled the training of feedforward networks with dozens to hundreds of layers using simple gradient descent.
While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.

In this report, we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately explain several recent findings.
We propose an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation---a group of successive layers iteratively refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely new representation.
We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the construction of highway and residual networks. 
Finally we provide preliminary experiments to discuss the similarities and differences between the two architectures."
CONTENT2VEC: SPECIALIZING JOINT REPRESENTATIONS OF PRODUCT IMAGES AND TEXT FOR THE TASK OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION,"We propose a unified product embedded representation that is optimized for the task of retrieval-based product recommendation. We generate this representation using Content2Vec, a new deep architecture that merges product content infor- mation such as text and image and we analyze its performance on hard recom- mendation setups such as cold-start and cross-category recommendations. In the case of a normal recommendation regime where collaborative information signal is available we merge the product co-occurence information and propose a sec- ond architecture Content2vec+ and show its lift in performance versus non-hybrid approaches."
Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation,"Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research. From a creativity research point of view, this offers the potential to study creativity in relationship with knowledge acquisition. From a machine learning perspective, however, several aspects of creativity need to be better defined to allow the machine learning community to develop and test hypotheses in a systematic way. We propose an actionable definition of creativity as the generation of out-of-distribution novelty. We assess several  metrics designed for evaluating the quality of generative models on this new task. We also propose a new experimental setup. Inspired by the usual held-out validation, we hold out entire classes for evaluating the generative potential of models. The goal of the novelty generator is then to use training classes to build a model that can generate objects from future (hold-out) classes, unknown at training time - and thus, are novel with respect to the knowledge the model incorporates. Through extensive experiments on various types of generative models, we are able to find architectures and hyperparameter combinations which lead to out-of-distribution novelty.

Improving Neural Language Models with a Continuous Cache,"We propose an extension to neural network language models to adapt their prediction to the recent history. Our model is a simplified version of memory augmented networks, which stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses them through a dot product with the current hidden activation. This mechanism is very efficient and scales to very large memory sizes. We also draw a link between the use of external memory in neural network and cache models used with count based language models. We demonstrate on several language model datasets that our approach performs significantly better than recent memory augmented networks."
Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation,"We study the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain. Given two related domains, S and T, we would like to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from S to the domain T, such that the output of a given function f, which accepts inputs in either domains, would remain unchanged. Other than the function f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain.
The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f-constancy component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity."
Third Person Imitation Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achiev- ing sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize. Humans overcome this difficulty by imitating other humans. Imitation learning in RL works well whenever the demonstrations are given in the first person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first person demonstrations.
Humans address this problem by learning from third person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves.
In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third person imitation learn- ing. By using ideas from domain confusion, we are able to train an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different view- point. Crucially, the agent receives only these demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states."
A Joint Many-Task Model: Growing a Neural Network for Multiple NLP Tasks,"Transfer and multi-task learning have traditionally focused on either a single source-target pair or very few, similar tasks. Ideally, the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics would benefit each other by being trained in a single model. We introduce such a joint many-task model together with a strategy for successively growing its depth to solve increasingly complex tasks. All layers include shortcut connections to both word representations and lower-level task predictions. We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing all model weights to improve one task's loss without exhibiting catastrophic interference of the other tasks. Our single end-to-end trainable model obtains state-of-the-art results on chunking, dependency parsing, semantic relatedness and textual entailment. It also performs competitively on POS tagging. Our dependency parsing layer relies only on a single feed-forward pass and does not require a beam search."
Representation Stability as a Regularizer for Neural Network Transfer Learning,"Although neural networks are well suited for sequential transfer learning tasks, the catastrophic forgetting problem hinders proper integration of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a multi-task objective based on the idea of distillation and a mechanism that directly penalizes forgetting at the shared representation layer during the knowledge integration phase of training. We demonstrate our approach on a Twitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from four related tasks.  We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned to the target task and we show through examples that it does not forget knowledge from the source task that is forgotten during standard fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that first distilling a human made rule based sentiment engine into a recurrent neural network and then integrating the knowledge with the target task data leads to a substantial gain in generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate the power of multi-source transfer techniques in practical text analytics problems when paired with distillation.  In particular, for the SemEval 2016 Task 4 Subtask A (Nakov et al., 2016) dataset we surpass the state of the art established during the competition with a comparatively simple model architecture that is not even competitive when trained just on the labeled task specific data."
Extensions and Limitations of the Neural GPU,"The Neural GPU is a recent model that can learn algorithms such as multi-digit binary addition and binary multiplication in a way that generalizes to inputs of arbitrary length.  We show that there are two simple ways of improving the performance of the Neural GPU: by carefully designing a curriculum, and by increasing model size.  The latter requires a memory efficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory intensive.  We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long numbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which, surprisingly, has not been possible before). We have also been able to train the Neural GPU to evaluate long arithmetic expressions with multiple operands that require respecting the  precedence order of the operands, although these have succeeded only in their binary representation, and not with perfect accuracy.

In addition, we gain insight into the Neural GPU by investigating its failure modes.  We find that Neural GPUs that correctly generalize to arbitrarily long numbers still fail to compute the correct answer on highly-symmetric, atypical inputs: for  example, a Neural GPU that achieves near-perfect generalization on decimal multiplication of up to 100-digit long numbers can fail on $000000\dots002 \times 000000\dots002$ while succeeding at $2 \times 2$.  These failure modes are reminiscent of adversarial examples."
DeepRebirth: A General Approach for Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,"Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is a challenging task due to computation complexity and memory intensity. Existing works solve this problem by reducing model size using weight approximation methods based on dimension reduction (i.e., SVD, Tucker decomposition and Quantization). However, the execution speed of these compressed models are still far below the real-time processing requirement of mobile services. To address this limitation, we propose a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth by exploring the deep learning model parameter sparsity through merging the parameter-free layers with their neighbor convolution layers to a single dense layer. The design of DeepRebirth is motivated by the key observation: some layers (i.e., normalization and pooling) in deep learning models actually consume a large portion of computational time even few learned parameters are involved, and acceleration of these layers has the potential to improve the processing speed significantly. Essentially, the functionality of several merged layers is replaced by the new dense layer – rebirth layer in DeepRebirth. In order to preserve the same functionality, the rebirth layer model parameters are re-trained to be functionality equivalent to the original several merged layers. The extensive experiments performed on ImageNet using several popular mobile devices demonstrate that DeepRebirth is not only providing huge speed-up in model deployment and significant memory saving but also maintaining the model accuracy, i.e., 3x-5x speed-up and energy saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% accuracy drop on top-5 categorization in ImageNet. Further, by combining with other model compression techniques, DeepRebirth offers an average of 65ms model forwarding time on each image using Samsung Galaxy S6 with only 2.4% accuracy drop. In addition, 2.5x run-time memory saving is achieved with rebirth layers."
Semi-Supervised Detection of Extreme Weather Events in Large Climate Datasets,"The detection and identification of extreme weather events in large scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management, informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system.
Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However, there are many different types of spatially localized climate patterns of interest (including hurricanes, extra-tropical cyclones, weather fronts, blocking events, etc.)
found in simulation data for which labeled data is not available at large scale.
We present a novel multichannel spatiotemporal encoder-decoder CNN architecture and loss for semi-supervised bounding box prediction and exploratory data analysis.
This architecture is designed to fully model multi-channel simulation data, temporal dynamics and unlabelled data within a reconstruction and prediction framework so as to improve both the detection and definition of a wider range of extreme weather events. 
Our architecture can be viewed as a 3D convolutional autoencoder with an additional modified one-pass bounding box regression loss. 
We demonstrate that our approach is able to leverage temporal information and unlabelled data to improve localization of extreme weather events. Further, we explore the representations learned by our model in order to better understand this important data, and facilitate further work in understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change."
Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation,"We study the problem of learning domain invariant representations for time series data while transferring the complex temporal latent dependencies between the domains. Our model termed as Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA) is built atop a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) and trains adversarially to capture complex temporal relationships that are domain-invariant. This is (as far as we know) the first to capture and transfer temporal latent dependencies in multivariate time-series data. Through experiments on real-world multivariate healthcare time-series datasets, we empirically demonstrate that learning temporal dependencies helps our model's ability to create domain-invariant representations, allowing our model to outperform current state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches."
Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model able to predict structured sequences of data. Precisely, GCRN is a generalization of classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) to data structured by any arbitrary graph. Such structured sequences can be series of frames in videos, spatio-temporal measurements on a network of sensors, or random walks on a vocabulary graph for natural language modeling.The proposed model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) on graphs to identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic patterns. We study two possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset. Experiments show that exploiting simultaneously graph spatial and dynamic information about data can improve both precision and learning speed.

End-to-End Answer Chunk Extraction and Ranking for Reading Comprehension,"This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions. DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR could achieve a 66.3% Exact match and 74.7% F1 score on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset."
Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,"Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world. In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes considerable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially visible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily
provide useful feedback on these implicit intermediate steps or sub-goals.
To address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward functions, which are dense and smooth, can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

Program Synthesis for Character Level Language Modeling,"We propose a statistical model applicable to character level language modeling and show that it is a good fit for both, program source code and English text. The model is parameterized by a program from a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows expressing non-trivial data dependencies. Learning is done in two phases: (i) we synthesize a program from the DSL, essentially learning a good representation for the data, and (ii) we learn parameters from the training data - the process is done via counting, as in simple language models such as n-gram.

Our experiments show that the precision of our model is comparable to that of neural networks while sharing a number of advantages with n-gram models such as fast query time and the capability to quickly add and remove training data samples. Further, the model is parameterized by a program that can be manually inspected, understood and updated, addressing a major problem of neural networks."
Episodic Exploration for Deep Deterministic Policies for StarCraft Micromanagement,"We consider scenarios from the real-time strategy game StarCraft as benchmarks for reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose micromanagement tasks, that is, the short-term, low-level control of army members during a battle. From a reinforcement learning point of view, these scenarios are challenging, as the state-action space is very large, and there is no obvious feature representation for the state-action evaluation function. We describe our approach to tackle the micromanagement scenarios with deep neural network controllers from raw state features given by the game engine. We also present a heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm which combines direct exploration in the policy space and backpropagation. This algorithm collects traces for learning using deterministic policies, which appears much more efficient than, e.g., ε-greedy exploration. Experiments show that this algorithm allows to successfully learn non-trivial strategies for scenarios with armies of up to 15 agents, where both Q-learning and REINFORCE struggle."
Sample Importance in Training Deep Neural Networks,"The contribution of each sample during model training varies across training iterations and the model's parameters. We define the concept of sample importance as the change in parameters induced by a sample. In this paper, we explored the sample importance in training deep neural networks using stochastic gradient descent. We found that ""easy"" samples -- samples that are correctly and confidently classified at the end of the training -- shape parameters closer to the output, while the ""hard"" samples impact parameters closer to the input to the network. Further, ""easy"" samples are relevant in the early training stages, and ""hard"" in the late training stage. Further, we show that constructing batches which contain samples of comparable difficulties tends to be a poor strategy compared to maintaining a mix of both hard and easy samples in all of the batches. Interestingly, this contradicts some of the results on curriculum learning which suggest that ordering training examples in terms of difficulty can lead to better performance."
Epitomic Variational Autoencoders,"In this paper, we propose epitomic variational autoencoder (eVAE), a probabilistic generative model of high dimensional data. eVAE is composed of a number of sparse variational autoencoders called `epitome' such that each epitome partially shares its encoder-decoder architecture with other epitomes in the composition. We show that the proposed model greatly overcomes the common problem in variational autoencoders (VAE) of model over-pruning. We substantiate that eVAE is efficient in using its model capacity and generalizes better than VAE, by presenting qualitative and quantitative results on MNIST and TFD datasets."
Soft Weight-Sharing for Neural Network Compression,"The success of deep learning in numerous application domains created the desire
to run and train them on mobile devices. This however, conflicts with their computationally, memory and energy intense nature, leading to a growing interest in compression.
Recent work by Han et al. (2016) propose a pipeline that involves retraining, pruning and quantization of neural network weights, obtaining state-of-the-art compression rates. In this paper, we show that competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version of ”soft weight-sharing” (Nowlan & Hinton, 1991). This point of view also exposes the relation between compression and the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Our method achieves both quantization and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure.

Structured Interpretation of Deep Generative Models,"Deep generative models provide a powerful and flexible means to learn complex distributions over data by incorporating neural networks into latent-variable models. Variational approaches to training such models introduce a probabilistic encoder that casts data, typically unsupervised, into an entangled and unstructured representation space. While unsupervised learning is often desirable, sometimes even necessary, when we lack prior knowledge about what to represent, being able to incorporate domain knowledge in characterising certain aspects of variation in the data can often help learn better disentangled representations. Here, we introduce a new formulation of semi-supervised learning in variational autoencoders that allows precisely this. It permits flexible specification of probabilistic encoders as directed graphical models via a stochastic computation graph, containing both continuous and discrete latent variables, with conditional distributions parametrised by neural networks. We demonstrate how the provision of structure, along with a few labelled examples indicating plausible values for some components of the latent space, can help quickly learn disentangled representations. We then evaluate its ability to do so, both qualitatively by exploring its generative capacity, and quantitatively by using the disentangled representation to perform classification, on a variety of models and datasets."
Low-rank passthrough neural networks,"Deep learning consists in training neural networks to perform computations that sequentially unfold in many steps over a time dimension or an intrinsic depth dimension. For large depths, this is usually accomplished by specialized network architectures that are designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, e.g. LSTMs, GRUs, Highway Networks and Deep Residual Networks, which are based on a single structural principle: the state passthrough. We observe that these ""Passthrough Networks"" architectures, enable the decoupling of the network state size from the number of parameters of the network, a possibility that is exploited in some recent works but not thoroughly explored. In this work we propose simple, yet effective, low-rank and low-rank plus diagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks which exploit this decoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory requirements of the network while preserving its memory capacity. We present competitive experimental results on several tasks, including a near state of the art result on sequential randomly-permuted MNIST classification, a hard task on natural data."
Neural Program Lattices,"We propose the Neural Program Lattice (NPL), a neural network which learns a hierarchical program structure based mostly on flat sequences of elementary operations. Compared to existing methods that can only learn from strong supervision such as full execution traces of programs, NPL learns with much weaker supervision and performs comparably well with the help of only a couple of full execution traces. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn tasks like addition and moving blocks in a grid-world. We show that by training mostly on unstructured operation sequences, NPL is able to extract the latent structures of sequences and learn to represent the program abstractions. Remarkably, NPL can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much less supervision than existing methods."
Tracking the World State with Recurrent Entity Networks,"We introduce a new model, the Recurrent Entity Network (EntNet). It is equipped
with a dynamic long-term memory which allows it to maintain and update a rep-
resentation of the state of the world as it receives new data. For language under-
standing tasks, it can reason on-the-fly as it reads text, not just when it is required
to answer a question or respond as is the case for a Memory Network (Sukhbaatar
et al., 2015). Like a Neural Turing Machine or Differentiable Neural Computer
(Graves et al., 2014; 2016) it maintains a fixed size memory and can learn to
perform location and content-based read and write operations. However, unlike
those models it has a simple parallel architecture in which several memory loca-
tions can be updated simultaneously. The EntNet sets a new state-of-the-art on
the bAbI tasks, and is the first method to solve all the tasks in the 10k training
examples setting. We also demonstrate that it can solve a reasoning task which
requires a large number of supporting facts, which other methods are not able to
solve, and can generalize past its training horizon. It can also be practically used
on large scale datasets such as Children’s Book Test, where it obtains competitive
performance, reading the story in a single pass."
Steerable CNNs,"It has long been recognized that for many visual tasks, the invariance and equivariance properties of a learned representation are critically important. In this paper we present the theory of Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks, and show that steerable CNNs achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Steerable CNNs produce representations that change in a predictable and linear way under transformations of the input. The mathematical theory of steerable representations reveals a type system in which any steerable representation is a composition of elementary feature types, each one associated with a particular kind of symmetry or invariance. We show how the parameter cost of a steerable filter bank depends on the types of the input and output features, and show how to use this knowledge to construct CNNs that utilize parameters effectively."
"Learning to Query, Reason, and Answer Questions On Ambiguous Texts","A key goal of research in conversational systems is to train an interactive agent to help a user with a task. Human conversation, however, is notoriously incomplete, ambiguous, and full of extraneous detail. To operate effectively, the agent must not only understand what was explicitly conveyed but also be able to reason in the presence of missing or unclear information. When unable to resolve ambiguities on its own, the agent must be able to ask the user for the necessary clarifications and incorporate the response in its reasoning. Motivated by this problem we introduce QRAQ (""crack""; Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a new synthetic domain, in which a User gives an Agent a short story and asks a challenge question. These problems are designed to test the reasoning and interaction capabilities of a learning-based Agent in a setting that requires multiple conversational turns. A good Agent should ask only non-deducible, relevant questions until it has enough information to correctly answer the User's question. We use standard and improved reinforcement learning based memory-network architectures to solve QRAQ problems in the difficult setting where the reward signal only tells the Agent if its final answer to the challenge question is correct or not. To provide an upper-bound to the RL results we also train the same architectures using supervised information that tells the Agent during training which variables to query and the answer to the challenge question. We evaluate our architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, and scale the complexity for each along multiple dimensions."
Inference and Introspection in Deep Generative Models of Sparse Data,"Deep generative models such as deep latent Gaussian models (DLGMs) are powerful and popular density estimators. However, they have been applied almost exclusively to dense data such as images; DLGMs are rarely applied to sparse, high-dimensional integer data such as word counts or product ratings. One reason is that the standard training procedures find poor local optima when applied to such data. We propose two techniques that alleviate this problem, significantly improving our ability to fit DLGMs to sparse, high-dimensional data. Having fit these models, we are faced with another challenge: how to use and interpret the representation that we have learned? To that end, we propose a method that extracts distributed representations of features via a simple linearization of the model. "
Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning,"While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (""PredNet"") architecture that is inspired by the concept of ""predictive coding"" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene. Furthermore, the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure."
Implicit ReasoNet: Modeling Large-Scale Structured Relationships with Shared Memory,"Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of learning embeddings from multi-step relations. However, due to the size of knowledge bases, learning multi-step relations directly on top of observed instances could be costly. In this paper, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), which is designed to perform large-scale inference implicitly through a search controller and shared memory. Unlike previous work, IRNs use training data to learn to perform multi-step inference through the shared memory, which is also jointly updated during training. While the inference procedure is not operating on top of observed instances for IRNs, our proposed model outperforms all previous approaches on the popular FB15k benchmark by more than 5.7%."
Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents a framework to tackle combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. We focus on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and train a recurrent network that, given a set of city coordinates, predicts a distribution over different city permutations. Using negative tour length as the reward signal, we optimize the parameters of the recurrent network using a policy gradient method. We compare learning the network parameters on a set of training graphs against learning them on individual test graphs. The best results are obtained when the network is first optimized on a training set and then refined on individual test graphs. Without any supervision and with minimal engineering, Neural Combinatorial Optimization achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes."
Diet Networks: Thin Parameters for Fat Genomics,"Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier."
Deep Biaffine Attention for Neural Dependency Parsing,"While deep learning parsing approaches have proven very successful at finding the structure of sentences, most neural dependency parsers use neural networks only for feature extraction, and then use those features in traditional parsing algorithms. In contrast, this paper builds off recent work using general-purpose neural network components, training an attention mechanism over an LSTM to attend to the head of the phrase. We get state-of-the-art results for standard dependency parsing benchmarks, achieving 95.44% UAS and 93.76% LAS on the PTB dataset, 0.8% and 1.0% improvement, respectively, over Andor et al. (2016). In addition to proposing a new parsing architecture using dimensionality reduction and biaffine interactions, we examine simple hyperparameter choices that had a profound influence on the model's performance, such as reducing the value of beta2 in the Adam optimization algorithm."
PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model for Natural Images,"Natural image modeling is a landmark challenge of unsupervised learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale for capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64x64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.

"Snapshot Ensembles: Train 1, Get M for Free","Ensembles of neural networks are known to give far more robust and accurate predictions compared to any of its individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal to obtain ensembles of multiple  neural network at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by letting a single neural network converge into several local minima along its optimization path and save the model parameters.  To obtain repeated rapid convergence we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as \emph{Snapshot Ensembling}, is surprisingly simple, yet effective.  We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with  diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields significantly lower error rates than state-of-the-art single  models at no additional training cost,  and almost matches the results of (far more expensive) independently trained network ensembles. On Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4% and 17.4% respectively."
Wav2Letter: an End-to-End ConvNet-based Speech Recognition System,"This paper presents a simple end-to-end model for speech recognition, combining a convolutional network based acoustic model and a graph decoding. It is trained to output letters, with transcribed speech, without the need for force alignment of phonemes. We introduce an automatic segmentation criterion for training from sequence annotation without alignment that is on par with CTC (Graves et al., 2006) while being simpler. We show competitive results in word error rate on the Librispeech corpus (Panayotov et al., 2015) with MFCC features, and promising results from raw waveform."
Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom.
Our framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning. Our model is simple in design and only uses game states from the AI side, rather than using opponents' information. On a known map, our agent won 10 out of the 11 attended games and the champion of Track1 in ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 by a large margin, 35\% higher score than the second place."
Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis,"Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training."
Decomposing Motion and Content for Natural Video Sequence Prediction,"We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences. To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos, we propose to decompose the motion and content, two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction, which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content, predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the pro- posed network architecture on the human activity videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end trainable network architecture with motion and content separation to model the spatio-temporal dynamics for pixel-level future prediction in natural videos."
Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values,"Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis."
Towards a Neural Statistician,"An efficient learner is one who reuses what they already know to tackle a new problem. For a machine learner, this means understanding the similarities amongst datasets. In order to do this, one must take seriously the idea of working with datasets, rather than datapoints, as the key objects to model. Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used for: clustering datasets, transferring generative models to new datasets, selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen classes."
Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy,"We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This optimized MMD is applied to the setting of unsupervised learning by generative adversarial networks (GAN), in which a model attempts to generate realistic samples, and a discriminator attempts to tell these apart from data samples. In this context, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator, either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the model’s samples against a reference data set. In the latter role, the optimized MMD is particularly helpful, as it gives an interpretable indication of how the model and data distributions differ, even in cases where individual model samples are not easily distinguished either by eye or by classifier."
Group Sparse CNNs for Question Sentence Classification with Answer Sets,"Classifying question sentences into their corresponding categories is an important task with wide applications, for example in many websites' FAQ sections. 
However, traditional question classification techniques do not fully utilize the well-prepared answer data which has great potential for improving question sentence representations which could lead to better classification performance. In order to encode answer information into question representation, we first introduce novel group sparse autoencoders which could utilize the group information in the answer set to refine question representation. We then propose a new group sparse convolutional neural network which could naturally learn the question representation with respect to their corresponding answers by implanting the group sparse autoencoders into the traditional convolutional neural network. The proposed model show significant improvements over strong baselines on four datasets.  "
Generalizing Skills with Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire complex behaviors from low-level inputs, such as images. However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while it is deployed and performing useful tasks. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, to tell the agent whether it is succeeding or failing at its task. Such reward functions are often hard to measure in the real world, especially in domains such as robotics and dialog systems, where the reward could depend on the unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. On the other hand, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present, or in a controlled laboratory setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect in the unstructured real world? In this paper, we formalize this problem setting as semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of “labeled” MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of “unlabeled” MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent’s own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available. We also show that our method outperforms direct supervised learning of the reward."
Unsupervised sentence representation learning with adversarial auto-encoder,"Representing sentence with fixed dimension vector is a key step towards better natural language understanding. However, it is a challenging task to capture both of the semantic and structural information conveyed by a sentence. With recent extremely popular deep learning techniques, we proposed an unsupervised sentence representation learning method, which is able to learn the sentence representation
from the unlabeled large corpus text data. We show that the model is able to generate plausible English sentence and interpolate between sentences. We also explore the effect of the model architecture and representation size in unsupervised learning case."
Unsupervised Program Induction with Hierarchical Generative Convolutional Neural Networks,"Automatically inferring a computer program that maps a set of inputs to outputs remains an open and extremely challenging problem. The program induction task is difficult due to the vast search space over possible programs, and the need to handle high-order logic, such as for-loops or recursion. In this paper, we automatically generate programs from input/output pairs using Hierarchical Generative Convolutional Neural Networks (HGCNN). The HGCNN predicts candidate lines of code in a hierarchical manner from which programs can be constructed using standard search techniques. Notably, the model is trained using only randomly generated programs, and can be viewed as an unsupervised approach. We show that the proposed method can generate programs ranging from simple procedures like \texttt{Swap} to more complex ones with loops and branches (e.g., finding the max element of an array). We also show promising results for nested-loop programs like Bubble Sort. Compared to baselines such as LSTMs, our approach achieves significantly better prediction accuracy."
NEWSQA: A MACHINE COMPREHENSION DATASET,"We present NewsQA, a challenging machine comprehension dataset of over 100,000 question-answer pairs. Crowdworkers supply questions and answers based on a set of over 10,000 news articles from CNN, with answers consisting in spans of text from the corresponding articles. We collect this dataset through a four- stage process designed to solicit exploratory questions that require reasoning. A thorough analysis confirms that NewsQA demands abilities beyond simple word matching and recognizing entailment. We measure human performance on the dataset and compare it to several strong neural models. The performance gap between humans and machines (25.3% F1) indicates that significant progress can be made on NewsQA through future research. The dataset is freely available at datasets.maluuba.com/NewsQA."
Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks,"Different neural network architectures, hyperparameters and training protocols lead to different performances as a function of time.
Human experts routinely inspect the resulting learning curves to quickly terminate runs with poor hyperparameter settings and thereby considerably speed up manual hyperparameter optimization. Exploiting the same information in automatic Bayesian hyperparameter optimization requires a probabilistic model of learning curves across hyperparameter settings. Here, we study the use of Bayesian neural networks for this purpose and improve their performance by a specialized learning curve layer."
Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension,"In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention. "
Neural Code Completion,"Code completion, an essential part of modern software development, yet can be
challenging for dynamically typed programming languages. In this paper we explore
the use of neural network techniques to automatically learn code completion
from a large corpus of dynamically typed JavaScript code. We show that by combining
limited parsing with an LSTM-based architecture we can outperform the
state-of-the-art probabilistic code modeling techniques by 11:1 points on the nonterminal
prediction task. We believe that neural network techniques can play a
transformative role in helping software developers manage the growing complexity
of software systems and see this work as a first step in that direction."
 A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Noise,"Adversarial samples are maliciously created inputs that force a machine learning classifier to produce wrong output labels. An adversarial sample is often generated by adding an adversarial noise (AN) on a normal sample. Recent literature has pointed out that machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks (DNN), are vulnerable to AN. Multiple studies have tried to analyze and thus harden machine classifiers under AN. However, they are mostly empirical, providing little understanding of the underline principles to evaluate and improve the robustness of a classier against AN. This paper proposes a unified framework using two metric spaces to evaluate  classifiers' robustness against AN and provides general guidance for hardening such classifiers. The central idea of our work is that the robustness of a classifier $f_1$ against AN is decided by both $f_1$ and its oracle $f_2$ (like human annotator). In particular: (1) By adding oracle $f_2$ into the framework, we provide a general definition of the adversarial sample problem. (2) We theoretically formulate a definition that decides whether a classifier is always robust against AN (strong-robustness); (3) Using two metric spaces ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$) defined by $f_1$ and $f_2$ respectively,  we prove that the topological equivalence between ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$) is sufficient in deciding whether $f_1$ is strong-robust at test time or not; (4) A novel measure referred as Adversarial Robustness of Classifier (ARC) is defined to quantify the robustness of a classifier against AN; (5) We propose a new defense strategy ``Siamese training'' to intuitively approach topological equivalence between ($X_1,d_1$) and ($X_2,d_2$).  By training a DNN classifier using the Siamese architecture, Siamese training increases the model robustness. Experimental results show that Siamese training helps multiple DNN models achieve better accuracy compared to previous defense strategies in an adversarial setting. Based on the proposed measure ARC, DNN models after Siamese training exhibit better robustness than the baselines.

Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks,"One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this structure, one must understand how different individual components of the overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on extracting links between argument components, with a secondary focus on classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a modification of a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links between argument components. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on two separate evaluation corpora. Furthermore, our results show that optimizing for both tasks, as well as adding a fully-connected layer prior to recurrent neural network input, is crucial for high performance."
Learning to Optimize,"Algorithm design is a laborious process and often requires many iterations of ideation and validation. In this paper, we explore automating algorithm design and present a method to learn an optimization algorithm. We approach this problem from a reinforcement learning perspective and represent any particular optimization algorithm as a policy. We learn an optimization algorithm using guided policy search and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing hand-engineered algorithms in terms of convergence speed and/or the final objective value.

A Compare-Aggregate Model for Matching Text Sequences,"Many NLP tasks including machine comprehension, answer selection and text entailment require the comparison between sequences. Matching the important units between sequences is a key to solve these problems. In this paper, we present a general ""compare-aggregate"" framework that performs word-level matching followed by aggregation using Convolutional Neural Networks. We particularly focus on the different comparison functions we can use to match two vectors. We use four different datasets to evaluate the model. We find that some simple comparison functions based on element-wise operations can work better than standard neural network and neural tensor network. "
Data Noising as Smoothing in Neural Network Language Models,"Data noising is an effective technique for regularizing neural network models. While noising is widely adopted in application domains such as vision and speech, commonly used noising primitives have not been developed for discrete sequence-level settings such as language modeling. In this paper, we derive a connection between input noising in neural network language models and smoothing in n-gram models. Using this connection, we draw upon ideas from smoothing to develop effective noising schemes. We demonstrate performance gains when applying the proposed schemes to language modeling and machine translation. Finally, we provide empirical analysis validating the relationship between noising and smoothing."
Training Compressed Fully-Connected Networks with a Density-Diversity Penalty,"Deep models have achieved great success on a variety of challenging tasks. How- ever, the models that achieve great performance often have an enormous number of parameters, leading to correspondingly great demands on both computational and memory resources, especially for fully-connected layers. In this work, we propose a new “density-diversity penalty” regularizer that can be applied to fully-connected layers of neural networks during training. We show that using this regularizer results in significantly fewer parameters (i.e., high sparsity), and also significantly fewer distinct values (i.e., low diversity), so that the trained weight matrices can be highly compressed without any appreciable loss in performance. The resulting trained models can hence reside on computational platforms (e.g., portables, Internet-of-Things devices) where it otherwise would be prohibitive."
Neural Variational Inference For Topic Models,"Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of
text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically
deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address
this problem is neural variational inference (NVI), but they have proven difficult to
apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective
neural variational inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),
tackling the problems caused for NVI by the Dirichlet prior and by component
collapsing. We find that NVI matches traditional methods in accuracy with much
better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is
unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on
test data. Because NVI is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As
a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that
replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only
one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable
topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling."
Tree-Structured Variational Autoencoder,"Many kinds of variable-sized data we would like to model contain an internal hierarchical structure in the form of a tree, including source code, formal logical statements, and natural language sentences with parse trees. For such data it is natural to consider a model with matching computational structure. In this work, we introduce a variational autoencoder-based generative model for tree-structured data. We evaluate our model on a synthetic dataset, and a dataset with applications to automated theorem proving. By learning a latent representation over trees, our model can achieve similar test log likelihood to a standard autoregressive decoder, but with the number of sequentially dependent computations proportional to the depth of the tree instead of the number of nodes in the tree."
Learning Approximate Distribution-Sensitive Data Structures,"We present a computational model of mental representations as data-structures which are distribution sensitive, i.e., which exploit non-uniformity in their usage patterns to reduce time or space complexity.
Abstract data types equipped with axiomatic specifications specify classes of concrete data structures with equivalent logical behavior.
We extend this formalism to distribution-sensitive data structures with the concept of a probabilistic axiomatic specification, which is implemented by a concrete data structure only with some probability.
We employ a number of approximations to synthesize several distribution-sensitive data structures from probabilistic specification as deep neural networks, such as a stack, queue, natural number, set, and binary tree."
Memory-augmented Attention Modelling for Videos,"Recent works on neural architectures have demonstrated the utility of attention mechanisms for a wide variety of tasks. Attention models used for problems such as image captioning typically depend on the image under consideration, as well as the previous sequence of words that come before the word currently being generated. While these types of models have produced impressive results, they are not able to model the higher-order interactions involved in problems such as video description/captioning, where the relationship between parts of the video and the concepts being depicted is complex. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel memory-based attention model for video description. Our model utilizes memories of past attention when reasoning about where to attend to in the current time step, similar to the central executive system proposed in human cognition. This allows the model to not only reason about local attention more effectively, it allows it to consider the entire sequence of video frames while generating each word. Evaluation on the challenging and popular MSVD and Charades datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms all previously proposed methods and leads to a new state of the art results in the video description."
Taming the waves: sine as activation function in deep neural networks,"Most deep neural networks use non-periodic and monotonic—or at least
quasiconvex— activation functions. While sinusoidal activation functions have
been successfully used for specific applications, they remain largely ignored and
regarded as difficult to train. In this paper we formally characterize why these
networks can indeed often be difficult to train even in very simple scenarios, and
describe how the presence of infinitely many and shallow local minima emerges
from the architecture. We also provide an explanation to the good performance
achieved on a typical classification task, by showing that for several network architectures
the presence of the periodic cycles is largely ignored when the learning
is successful. Finally, we show that there are non-trivial tasks—such as learning
algorithms—where networks using sinusoidal activations can learn faster than
more established monotonic functions."
Optimization as a Model for Few-Shot Learning,"Though deep neural networks have shown great success in the large data domain, they generally perform poorly on few-shot learning tasks, where a model has to quickly generalize after seeing very few examples from each class. The general belief is that gradient-based optimization in high capacity models requires many iterative steps over many examples to perform well. Here, we propose an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network in the few-shot regime. The parametrization of our model allows it to learn appropriate parameter updates specifically for the scenario where a set amount of updates will be made, while also learning a general initialization of the learner network that allows for quick convergence of training. We demonstrate that this meta-learning model is competitive with deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning. "
Lifelong Perceptual Programming By Example,"We introduce and develop solutions for the problem of Lifelong Perceptual Programming By Example (LPPBE). The problem is to induce a series of programs that require understanding perceptual data like images or text. LPPBE systems learn from weak supervision (input-output examples) and incrementally construct a shared library of components that grows and improves as more tasks are solved. Methodologically, we extend differentiable interpreters to operate on perceptual data and to share components across tasks. Empirically we show that this leads to a lifelong learning system that transfers knowledge to new tasks more effectively than baselines, and the performance on earlier tasks continues to improve even as the system learns on new, different tasks."
Optimal Binary Autoencoding with Pairwise Correlations,"We formulate learning of a binary autoencoder as a biconvex optimization problem which learns from the pairwise correlations between encoded and decoded bits. Among all possible algorithms that use this information, ours finds the autoencoder that reconstructs its inputs with worst-case optimal loss. The optimal decoder is a single layer of artificial neurons, emerging entirely from the minimax loss minimization, and with weights learned by convex optimization. All this is reflected in competitive experimental results, demonstrating that binary autoencoding can be done efficiently by conveying information in pairwise correlations in an optimal fashion. "
On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models,"The past several years have seen remarkable progress in generative models which produce convincing samples of images and other modalities. A shared component of some popular models such as generative adversarial networks and generative moment matching networks, is a decoder network, a parametric deep neural net that defines a generative distribution. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to quantify the performance of these models because of the intractability of log-likelihood estimation, and inspecting samples can be misleading. We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling for evaluating log-likelihoods for decoder-based models and validate its accuracy using bidirectional Monte Carlo. Using this technique, we analyze the performance of decoder-based models, the effectiveness of existing log-likelihood estimators, the degree of overfitting, and the degree to which these models miss important modes of the data distribution."
Trained Ternary Quantization,"Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it’s as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values(2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16× smaller than full- precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%."
Automated Generation of Multilingual Clusters for the Evaluation of Distributed Representations,"We propose a language-agnostic way of automatically generating sets of semantically similar clusters of entities along with sets of ""outlier"" elements, which may then be used to perform an intrinsic evaluation of word embeddings in the outlier detection task. We used our methodology to create a gold-standard dataset, which we call WikiSem500, and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art embeddings. The results show a correlation between performance on this dataset and performance on sentiment analysis."
DSD: Dense-Sparse-Dense Training for Deep Neural Networks,"Modern deep neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them very powerful in learning representations. A critical issue for training such large networks on large-scale datasets is to prevent overfitting while at the same time providing enough model capacity. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for regularizing deep neural networks. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense) step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint, re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero, and retrain the whole dense network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification, caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1 accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.1% and ResNet-50 by 0.9%. On the WSJ’92 and WSJ’93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech WER by 0.6% and 2.0%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. At training time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S step. At testing time, DSD doesn’t change the network architecture or incur any inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD in our numerical experiments highlights the inadequacy of current deep learning training methods, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization performance for finding better solution. DSD models are available to download at https://songhan.github.io/DSD."
Convolutional Neural Networks Generalization Utilizing the Data Graph Structure,"Convolutional Neural Networks have proved to be very efficient in image and audio processing. Their success is mostly attributed to the convolutions which utilize the geometric properties of a low - dimensional grid structure. This paper suggests a generalization of CNNs to graph-structured data with varying graph structure, that can be applied to standard regression or classification problems by learning the graph structure of the data. We propose a novel convolution framework approach on graphs which utilizes a random walk to select relevant nodes. The convolution shares weights on all features, providing the desired parameter efficiency.  Furthermore, the additional computations in the training process are only executed once in the pre-processing step.  We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed CNN on MNIST data set, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular activity data set."
A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics,"We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), an object-based neural network architecture for learning predictive models of intuitive physics. We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and also the NPE architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions. Our approach draws on the strengths of both symbolic and neural approaches: like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions, but as a neural network it can also be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that our model's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize to different numbers of objects, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass."
Shift Aggregate Extract Networks,"The Shift Aggregate Extract Network SAEN is an architecture for learning representations on social network data.
SAEN decomposes input graphs into hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects.
Vector representations of each object are learnt by applying 'shift', 'aggregate' and 'extract' operations on the vector representations of its parts.
We propose an algorithm for domain compression which takes advantage of symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce the memory usage and obtain significant speedups.
Our method is empirically evaluated on real world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art."
Evaluation of Defensive Methods for DNNs against Multiple Adversarial Evasion Models,"Due to deep cascades of nonlinear units, deep neural networks (DNNs) can automatically learn non-local generalization priors from data and have achieved high performance in various applications.
However, such properties have also opened a door for adversaries to generate the so-called adversarial examples to fool DNNs. Specifically, adversaries can inject small perturbations to the input data and therefore decrease the performance of deep neural networks significantly.
Even worse, these adversarial examples have the transferability to attack a black-box model based on finite queries without knowledge of the target model. 
Therefore, we aim to empirically compare different defensive strategies against various adversary models and analyze the cross-model efficiency for these robust learners. We conclude that the adversarial retraining framework also has the transferability, which can defend adversarial examples without requiring prior knowledge of the adversary models.
We compare the general adversarial retraining framework with the state-of-the-art robust deep neural networks, such as distillation, autoencoder stacked with classifier (AEC), and our improved version, IAEC, to evaluate their robustness as well as the vulnerability in terms of the distortion required to mislead the learner.
Our experimental results show that the adversarial retraining framework can defend most of the adversarial examples notably and consistently without adding additional
vulnerabilities or performance penalty to the original model."
Learning to Remember Rare Events,"Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still limited
when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in remembering rare events.
We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning.
The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and
thus scales to large memory sizes.
Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable
and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision.  It operates in
a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training.

Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network.
To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple
convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence
and recurrent-convolutional models.
In all cases, the enhanced network gains the ability to remember
and do life-long one-shot learning.
Our module remembers training examples shown many thousands
of steps in the past and it can successfully generalize from them.
We match best previous results for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset
and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long one-shot learning in
recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine translation task."
Transfer Learning for Sequence Tagging with Hierarchical Recurrent Networks,"Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on several different sequence tagging tasks. One appealing property of such systems is their generality, as excellent performance can be achieved with a unified architecture and without task-specific feature engineering.  However, it is unclear if such systems can be used for tasks without large amounts of training data. In this paper we explore the problem of transfer learning for neural sequence taggers, where a source task with plentiful annotations (e.g., POS tagging on Penn Treebank) is used to improve performance on a target task with fewer available annotations (e.g., POS tagging for microblogs). We examine the effects of transfer learning for deep hierarchical recurrent networks across domains, applications, and languages, and show that significant improvement can often be obtained.  These improvements lead to improvements over the current state-of-the-art on several well-studied tasks."
Words or Characters? Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension,"Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test dataset. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task."
Programming With a Differentiable Forth Interpreter,"There are families of neural networks that can learn to compute any function, provided sufficient training data. However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements. "
Bit-Pragmatic Deep Neural Network Computing,"We quantify a source of ineffectual computations when processing the multiplications of the convolutional layers in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and propose Pragrmatic (PRA), an architecture that exploits it improving performance and energy efficiency. 
The source of these ineffectual computations is best understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which added together produce the final product. At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, PRA calculates only the non-zero terms resulting in a design whose execution time for convolutional layers is ideally proportional to the number of activation bits that are 1. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers on Convolutional Neural Networks and during inference, PRA improves performance by 3.1x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator and by  3.5x when DaDN uses an 8-bit quantized representation. DaDN was reported to be 300x faster than commodity graphics processors. "
Collaborative Deep Embedding via Dual Networks,"Despite the long history of research on recommender systems, current approaches still face a number of challenges in practice, e.g. the difficulties in handling new items, the high diversity of user interests, and the noisiness and sparsity of observations. Many of such difficulties stem from the lack of expressive power to capture the complex relations between items and users. This paper presents a new method to tackle this problem, called Collaborative Deep Embedding. In this method, a pair of dual networks, one for encoding items and the other for users, are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion. 
Particularly, both networks produce embeddings at multiple aligned levels, which, when combined together, can accurately predict the matching between items and users. Compared to existing methods, the proposed one not only provides greater expressive power to capture complex matching relations, but also generalizes better to unseen items or users. On multiple real-world datasets, this method outperforms the state of the art."
A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings,"
The success of neural network methods for computing word embeddings has motivated methods for generating semantic embeddings of longer pieces of text, such as sentences and paragraphs. Surprisingly, Wieting et al (ICLR'16) showed that such complicated methods are outperformed, especially in out-of-domain (transfer learning) settings, by simpler methods involving mild retraining of word embeddings and basic linear regression. The  method of Wieting et al. requires retraining with a substantial labeled dataset such as Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). 

The current paper goes further, showing that the following completely unsupervised sentence embedding is a formidable baseline: Use word embeddings computed using one of the popular methods on unlabeled corpus like Wikipedia, represent the sentence by a weighted average of the word vectors, and then modify them a bit using PCA/SVD. This weighting improves performance by about 10% to 30% in textual similarity tasks, and beats sophisticated supervised methods including RNN's and LSTM's. It even improves Wieting et al.'s embeddings. 
 This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in future, especially when labeled training data is scarce or nonexistent. 

The paper also gives a theoretical explanation of the success of the above unsupervised method using a latent variable generative model for sentences, which is a simple extension of the model in Arora et al. (TACL'16) with new ""smoothing"" terms that allow for 
words occurring out of context, as well as high probabilities for words like and, not in all contexts. "
Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Two potential bottlenecks on the expressiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are their ability to store information about the task in their parameters, and to store information about the input history in their units. We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further find that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing RNN architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difficulty for several architectures, and show that vanilla RNNs are far more difficult to train, yet have higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel RNN architectures, one of which is easier to train than the LSTM or GRU."
Transformation-based Models of Video Sequences,"In this work we propose a simple unsupervised approach for next frame prediction in video. Instead of directly predicting the pixels in a frame given past frames, we predict the transformations needed for generating the next frame in a sequence, given the transformations of the past frames. This leads to sharper results, while using a smaller prediction model.

In order to enable a fair comparison between different video frame prediction models, we also propose a new evaluation protocol. We use generated frames as input to a classifier trained with ground truth sequences. This criterion guarantees that models scoring high are those producing sequences which preserve discrim- inative features, as opposed to merely penalizing any deviation, plausible or not, from the ground truth. Our proposed approach compares favourably against more sophisticated ones on the UCF-101 data set, while also being more efficient in terms of the number of parameters and computational cost."
Evaluation of Deep Learning Frameworks over Different HPC Architectures,"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers across many disciplines to uncover new insights about large datasets. Deep neural networks have shown applicability to image, time-series, textual, and other data, all of which are available in a plethora of research fields. However, their computational complexity and large memory overhead requires advanced software and hardware technologies to train neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. To make this possible, there has been an influx in development of deep learning software that aim to leverage advanced hardware resources. In order to better understand the performance implications of deep learning frameworks over different these different resources, we analyze the performance of three different frameworks, Caffe, TensorFlow, and Apache SINGA, over several hardware environments. This includes scaling up and out with single- and multi-node setups using different CPU and GPU. Notably, we investigate the performance characteristics of NVIDIA's state-of-the-art hardware technology, NVLink, with respect to training time and GPU utilization. To our best knowledge, this is the first work concerning deep learning bench-marking with NVLink. Through these experiments, we provide analysis of the frameworks' performance over different hardware environments in terms of speed and scaling. As a result of this work, better insight is given towards both using and developing deep learning tools that cater to current and upcoming hardware technologies."
Neural Causal Regularization under the Independence of Mechanisms Assumption,"Neural networks provide a powerful framework for learning the association between input and response variables and making accurate predictions. However, in many applications such as healthcare, we are interested in identifying causal relationships between the inputs and the response variables to be able to change the response variables by intervention in the inputs.

In pursuit of causally predictive models, whose predictive power is maximally stemmed from causal connections, we propose a novel neural network structure based on the independence of mechanisms assumption. In particular, we first construct a causality detector based on a neural network and then use its scores to design a causal regularizer which encourages causality in predictive models. Then, we show that we can utilize the causal regularizer in flexible deep neural networks to make the result causal. For the first time, we perform a large-scale causally predictive analysis on electronic health records and demonstrate the success of the proposed algorithm."
Learning to Perform Physics Experiments via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.
"
Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback."
Recursive Regression with Neural Networks: Approximating the HJI PDE Solution,"Most machine learning applications using neural networks seek to approximate some function g(x) by minimizing some cost criterion. In the simplest case, if one has access to pairs of the form (x, y) where y = g(x), the problem can be framed as a simple regression problem. Beyond this family of problems, we find many important cases where g(x) is unknown so this approach is not always viable. However, similar to what we find in the work of Mnih et al. (2013), if we have some known properties of the function we are seeking to approximate, there is still hope to frame the problem as a regression problem. In this work, we show this in the context of trying to approximate the solution to a particular partial differential equation known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs PDE found in the fields of control theory and robotics."
Deep Learning with Dynamic Computation Graphs,"Neural networks that compute over graph structures are a natural fit for problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature."
Recurrent Coevolutionary Feature Embedding Processes for Recommendation,"Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of users and capture the properties of items. As users interact with different items over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and co-evolve over time. To accurately capture the fine grained nonlinear coevolution of these features, we propose a recurrent coevolutionary feature embedding process model, which combines recurrent neural network (RNN) with a multi-dimensional point process model. The RNN learns a nonlinear representation of user and item embeddings which take into account mutual influence between user and item features, and the feature evolution over time. We also develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning parameters. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in user behavior prediction compared to state-of-the-arts. "
Nonparametrically Learning Activation Functions in Deep Neural Nets,"We provide a principled framework for nonparametrically learning activation functions in deep neural networks. Currently, state-of-the-art deep networks treat choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter before training. By allowing activation functions to be estimated as part of the training procedure, we expand the class of functions that each node in the network can learn. We also provide a theoretical justification for our choice of nonparametric activation functions and demonstrate that networks with our nonparametric activation functions generalize well. To demonstrate the power of our novel techniques, we test them on image recognition datasets and achieve up to a 15% relative increase in test performance compared to the baseline."
Can the Student Outdo the Master? Leveraging Human Driving Instruction using Deep Learning,"We propose a scheme for training a computerized agent to perform complex human tasks such as highway steering.
The scheme is designed to follow a natural learning process whereby a human instructor teaches a computerized trainee.  The learning process consists of three phases, where in the first the agent learns to  mimic the human instructor using supervised learning and reach a basic performance level; the second phase is devoted to learning an instantaneous reward model. 
Here, the instructor observes (possibly in real time) the agent performing the task and provides reward feedback.
During this phase a machine monitors both the agent and the instructor feedback and learns a reward model using supervised learning. 
This phase terminates when the reward model is sufficiently accurate.
In the third phase a RL algorithm is deployed to optimize the agent policy.
The guidance reward signal in the RL algorithm relies on the previously learned reward model.
As a proof of concept for the proposed scheme, we designed a system consisting of deep convolutional neural networks, and applied it
to successfully learn a computerized agent capable of autonomous highway steering over the well-known racing game Assetto Corsa."
L-SR1: A Second Order Optimization Method for Deep Learning,"We describe L-SR1, a new second order method to train deep neural networks. Second order methods hold great promise for distributed training of deep networks. Unfortunately, they have not proven practical. Two significant barriers to their success are inappropriate handling of saddle points, and poor conditioning of the Hessian. L-SR1 is a practical second order method that addresses these concerns. We provide experimental results showing that L-SR1 performs at least as well as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Descent, on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. For the CIFAR10 dataset, we see competitive performance on shallow networks like LeNet5, as well as on deeper networks like residual networks. Furthermore, we perform an experimental analysis of L-SR1 with respect to its hyper-parameters to gain greater intuition. Finally, we outline the potential usefulness of L-SR1 in distributed training of deep neural networks."
Calibrating Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples.
Specifically, we propose a flexible adversarial training framework, and prove this framework not only ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution, but also enables the discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimal.
We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze the properties.
In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques.
Empirically, the experiment results closely match our theoretical analysis, verifying the discriminator is able to recover the energy of data distribution."
Inverse Problems in Computer Vision using  Adversarial  Imagination Priors,"Given an image,  humans  effortlessly run the image formation process backwards in their minds: they can tell albedo from shading,  foreground from background, and imagine the occluded parts of the scene behind foreground objects. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised inversion machine trained to generate similar imaginations that when rendered using differentiable, graphics-like decoders, produce the original visual input. We constrain the imagination spaces by providing exemplar memory repositories in the form of foreground segmented objects, albedo, shading, background scenes and imposing adversarial losses on the imagination spaces. Our model learns to perform such inversion with weak supervision, without ever having seen paired annotated data, that is, without having seen the image paired with the corresponding ground-truth imaginations. We demonstrate our method by applying it to three  Computer Vision tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic decomposition and object segmentation, each task having its own differentiable renderer.  Data driven adversarial imagination priors  effectively guide inversion,  minimize the need for hand designed priors of smoothness or good continuation, or the need for paired annotated data."
Leveraging Asynchronicity in Gradient Descent for Scalable Deep Learning,"In this paper, we present multiple approaches for improving the performance of gradient descent when utilizing mutiple compute resources. The proposed approaches span a solution space ranging from equivalence to running on a single compute device to delaying gradient updates a fixed number of times. We present a new approach, asynchronous layer-wise gradient descent that maximizes overlap of layer-wise backpropagation (computation) with gradient synchronization (communication). This approach provides maximal theoretical equivalence to the de facto gradient descent algorithm, requires limited asynchronicity across multiple iterations of gradient descent, theoretically improves overall speedup, while minimizing the additional space requirements for asynchronicity. We implement all of our proposed approaches using Caffe – a high performance Deep Learning library – and evaluate it on both an Intel Sandy Bridge cluster connected with InfiniBand as well as an NVIDIA DGX-1 connected with NVLink. The evaluations are performed on a set of well known workloads including AlexNet and GoogleNet on the ImageNet dataset. Our evaluation of these neural network topologies indicates asynchronous gradient descent has a speedup of up to 1.7x compared to synchronous."
Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning,"Humans learn a predictive model of the world and use this model to reason about future events and the consequences of actions. In contrast to most machine predictors, we exhibit an impressive ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and reason intelligently in these settings.  One important aspect of this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution.  Our task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks. We demonstrate that an unsupervised model, trained to predict future frames of a video sequence of stable and unstable block configurations, can yield features that support extrapolating stability prediction to blocks configurations outside the training set distribution"
Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks,"Filters in a convolutional network are typically parametrized in a pixel basis. As an orthonormal basis, pixels may represent any arbitrary vector in Rn. In this paper, we relax this orthonormality requirement and extend the set of viable bases to the generalized notion of frames. We introduce a range of orthogonal, non-orthogonal and overcomplete frames as alternatives to the standard pixel basis. When applying frame bases to ResNets on Cifar-10+ we demonstrate improved error rates by substitution only. By exploiting the transformation properties of such generalized bases, we arrive at steerable frames, that allow to continuously transform ConvNet filters under arbitrary Lie-groups. Further allowing us to locally separate pose from canonical appearance. We implement this in the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, that dynamically estimates the transformations of filters, conditioned on its input. The derived method can be implemented in any convolutional architecture, as we illustrate in two examples. First, we illustrate estimation properties of steerable frames with a Dynamic Steerable Frame Network, compared to a Dynamic Filter Network on the task of edge detection, where we show clear advantages of the derived steerable frames. Lastly, we insert the Dynamic Steerable Frame Network as a module in a convolutional LSTM on the task of limited-data hand-gesture recognition from video and illustrate effective dynamic regularization. In this paper, we have laid out the foundations of Frame-based convolutional networks and Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks while illustrating their advantages for continuously transforming features and data-efficient learning."
Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks,"Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in many perception and language processing applications.  Recently, more complex architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation, creating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we explore the low-overhead and easy-to-implement optimization technique of adding annealed Gaussian noise to the gradient, which we find surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures.  Unlike classical weight noise, gradient noise injection is complementary to advanced stochastic optimization algorithms such as Adam and AdaGrad. The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower training loss. We see consistent improvements in performance across an array of complex models, including state-of-the-art deep networks for question answering and algorithm learning. We observe that this optimization strategy allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network to escape a bad initialization with standard stochastic gradient descent. We encourage further application of this technique to additional modern neural architectures."
Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog,"Traditional dialog systems used in goal-oriented applications require a lot of domain-specific handcrafting, which hinders scaling up to new domains. End- to-end dialog systems, in which all components are trained from the dialogs themselves, escape this limitation. But the encouraging successes recently obtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This paper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of restaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols, so as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform non-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to a hand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). We show similar result patterns on data extracted from an online concierge service."
Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference,"We propose a new formulation for pruning convolutional kernels in neural networks to enable efficient inference. We interleave greedy criteria-based pruning with fine-tuning by backpropagation - a computationally efficient procedure that maintains good generalization in the pruned network. We propose a new criterion based on Taylor expansion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters. We focus on transfer learning, where large pretrained networks are adapted to specialized tasks. The proposed criterion demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation, for pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks (Birds-200 and Flowers-102). We also show that pruning can lead to more than 10x reduction in adapted 3D-convolutional filters with a small drop in accuracy in a recurrent gesture classifier. Finally, we show results for the large-scale ImageNet dataset to emphasize the flexibility of our approach."
Deep Learning with Sets and Point Clouds,"We study a simple notion of structural invariance that readily suggests a parameter-sharing scheme in deep neural networks.
In particular, we define structure as a collection of relations, and derive graph convolution and recurrent neural networks as special cases. We study composition of basic structures in defining models that are invariant to more complex ``product'' structures such as graph of graphs, sets of images or sequence of sets. For demonstration, our experimental results are focused on the setting where the discrete structure of interest is a ""set"".
We present results on several novel and non-trivial problems on sets, including point-cloud classification, set outlier detection and semi-supervised learning using clustering information."
Joint Training of Ratings and Reviews with Recurrent Recommender Networks,"Accurate modeling of ratings and text reviews is at the core of successful recommender systems. While neural networks have been remarkably successful in modeling images and natural language, they have been largely unexplored in recommender system research. In this paper, we provide a  neural network model that combines ratings, reviews, and temporal patterns to learn highly accurate recommendations. We co-train for prediction on both numerical ratings and natural language reviews, as well as using a recurrent architecture to capture the dynamic components of users' and items' states. We demonstrate that incorporating text reviews and temporal dynamic gives state-of-the-art results over the IMDb dataset."
Counterpoint by Convolution,"Machine learning models of music typically break down the task of composition into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. We explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human approach, and introduce Coconet, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models. Despite ostensibly sampling from the same distribution as the NADE ancestral sampling procedure, we find that a blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality. We provide evidence that this is due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al. (2014) yields better samples than ancestral sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of our method on unconditioned polyphonic music generation."
The loss surface of residual networks: Ensembles and the role of batch normalization,"Deep Residual Networks present a premium in performance in comparison to conventional
networks of the same depth and are trainable at extreme depths. It has
recently been shown that Residual Networks behave like ensembles of relatively
shallow networks. We show that these ensemble are dynamic: while initially
the virtual ensemble is mostly at depths lower than half the network’s depth, as
training progresses, it becomes deeper and deeper. The main mechanism that controls
the dynamic ensemble behavior is the scaling introduced, e.g., by the Batch
Normalization technique. We explain this behavior and demonstrate the driving
force behind it. As a main tool in our analysis, we employ generalized spin glass
models, which we also use in order to study the number of critical points in the
optimization of Residual Networks."
Exponential Machines,"Modeling interactions between features improves the performance of machine learning solutions in many domains (e.g. recommender systems or sentiment analysis). In this paper, we introduce Exponential Machines (ExM), a predictor that models all interactions of every order. The key idea is to represent an exponentially large tensor of parameters in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT). The Tensor Train format regularizes the model and lets you control the number of underlying parameters. To train the model, we develop a stochastic Riemannian optimization procedure, which allows us to fit tensors with 2^160 entries. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data with high-order interactions and that it works on par with high-order factorization machines on a recommender system dataset MovieLens 100K."
Query-Reduction Networks for Question Answering,"In this paper, we study the problem of question answering when reasoning over multiple facts is required. We propose Query-Reduction Network (QRN), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that effectively handles both short-term (local) and long-term (global) sequential dependencies to reason over multiple facts. QRN considers the context sentences as a sequence of state-changing triggers, and reduces the original query  to an easier-to-answer query as it observes each trigger (context sentence) through time. Our experiments show that QRN produces the state-of-the-art results in  bAbI QA and dialog tasks, and in a real goal-oriented dialog dataset. In addition, QRN formulation allows parallelization on RNN's time axis, saving an order of magnitude in time complexity for training and inference.  "
Singularity of the Hessian in Deep Learning,"We look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training. The eigenvalue distribution is seen to be composed of two parts, the bulk which is concentrated around zero, and the edges which are scattered away from zero. We present empirical evidence for the bulk indicating how over-parametrized the system is, and for the edges indicating the complexity of the input data."
Designing Neural Network Architectures using Reinforcement Learning,"At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We propose a meta-modeling approach based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks."
Local minima in training of deep networks,"There has been a lot of recent interest in trying to characterize the error surface of deep models. This stems from a long standing question. Given that deep networks are highly nonlinear systems optimized by local gradient methods, why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? It is widely believed that training of deep models using gradient methods works so well because the error surface either has no local minima, or if they exist they need to be close in value to the global minimum. It is known that such results hold under very strong assumptions which are not satisfied by real models. In this paper we present examples showing that for such theorem to be true additional assumptions on the data, initialization schemes and/or the model classes have to be made. We look at the particular case of finite size datasets. We demonstrate that in this scenario one can construct counter-examples (datasets or initialization schemes) when the network does become susceptible to many bad local minima over the weight space."
Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer,"Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language processing. A recently released dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), offers a large number of real questions and their answers created by humans through crowdsourcing. SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable lengths. We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al. (2015) to constrain the output tokens to be from the input sequences. We propose two ways of using Pointer Net for our task. Our experiments show that both of our two models substantially outperform the best results obtained by Rajpurkar et al. (2016) using logistic regression and manually crafted features."
Communicating Hierarchical Neural Controllers for Learning Zero-shot Task Generalization,"The ability to generalize from past experience to solve previously unseen tasks is a key research challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we consider RL tasks defined as a sequence of high-level instructions and study two types of generalization: to unseen and longer sequences of previously seen instructions, and to sequences where the instructions themselves were previously not seen. We present a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture that consists of two interacting neural controllers: a meta controller that reads instructions and repeatedly communicates subtasks to a subtask controller that in turn learns to perform such subtasks. To generalize better to unseen instructions, we propose a regularizer that encourages to learn subtask embeddings that capture correspondences between similar subtasks. We also propose a new differentiable neural network architecture in the meta controller that learns temporal abstractions which makes learning more stable under delayed reward. Our architecture is evaluated on a non-deterministic 2D grid world where the agent should execute a list of instructions described by natural language. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture is able to generalize well over unseen instructions as well as longer lists of instructions."
Towards Principled Methods for Training Generative Adversarial Networks,"The goal of this paper is not to introduce a single algorithm or method, but to make theoretical steps towards fully understanding the training dynamics of gen- erative adversarial networks. In order to substantiate our theoretical analysis, we perform targeted experiments to verify our assumptions, illustrate our claims, and quantify the phenomena. This paper is divided into three sections. The first sec- tion introduces the problem at hand. The second section is dedicated to studying and proving rigorously the problems including instability and saturation that arize when training generative adversarial networks. The third section examines a prac- tical and theoretically grounded direction towards solving these problems, while introducing new tools to study them."
DeepDSL: A Compilation-based Domain-Specific Language for Deep Learning,"In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has found great success in domains such as multimedia understanding. However, the complex nature of multimedia data makes it difficult to develop DL-based software. The state-of-the-art tools, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch7, and CNTK, while are successful in their applicable domains, are programming libraries with 
fixed user interface, internal representation, and execution environment. This makes it difficult to implement portable and customized DL applications.

In this paper, we present DeepDSL, a domain specific language (DSL) embedded in Scala, that compiles deep networks written in DeepDSL to Java source code. Deep DSL provides 
(1) intuitive constructs to support compact encoding of deep networks; 
(2) symbolic gradient derivation of the networks; 
(3) static analysis for memory consumption and error detection; and 
(4) DSL-level optimization to improve memory and runtime efficiency. 

DeepDSL programs are compiled into compact, efficient, customizable, and portable Java source code, which operates the CUDA and CUDNN interfaces running on Nvidia GPU
via a Java Native Interface (JNI) library. We evaluated DeepDSL with a number of popular DL networks. While the DeepDSL code is less than 100 lines for each of the network (e.g. Alexnet, GoogleNet, VGG, Overfeat, and Deep Residual Network), the compiled Java programs are highly efficient. Our experiments show that the compiled programs have very competitive runtime performance and memory efficiency compared to the existing libraries.

The Preimage of Rectifier Network Activities,"The preimage of the activity at a certain level of a deep network is the set of inputs that result in the same node activity. For fully connected multi layer rectifier networks we demonstrate how to compute the preimages of activities at arbitrary levels from knowledge of the parameters in a deep rectifying network. If the preimage set of a certain activity in the network contains elements from more than one class it means that these classes are irreversibly mixed. This implies that preimage sets which are piecewise linear manifolds are building blocks for describing the input manifolds specific classes, i.e. all preimages should ideally be from the same class. We believe that the knowledge of how to compute preimages will be valuable in understanding the efficiency displayed by deep learning networks and could potentially be used in designing more efficient training algorithms."
Neural Machine Translation with Latent Semantic of Image and Text,"Although attention-based Neural Machine Translation have achieved great success, attention-mechanism cannot capture the entire meaning of the source sentence because the attention mechanism generates a target word depending heavily on the relevant parts of the source sentence. The report of earlier studies has introduced a latent variable to capture the entire meaning of sentence and achieved improvement on attention-based Neural Machine Translation. We follow this approach and we believe that the capturing meaning of sentence benefits from image information because human beings understand the meaning of language not only from textual information but also from perceptual information such as that gained from vision. As described herein, we propose a neural machine translation model that introduces a continuous latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from texts and images. Our model, which can be trained end-to-end, requires image information only when training. Experiments conducted with an English–German translation task show that our model outperforms over the baseline."
Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension,"Machine Comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the query. Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically these methods use attention to summarize the context (or query) into a single vector, couple attentions temporally, and often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses a bi-directional attention flow mechanism to achieve a query-aware context representation without early summarization. Our experimental evaluations show that our  model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail Cloze Test."
Submodular Sum-product Networks for Scene Understanding,"Sum-product networks (SPNs) are an expressive class of deep probabilistic models in which inference takes time linear in their size, enabling them to be learned effectively. For challenging problems such as scene understanding, however, SPNs are intractable. In this work, we introduce submodular sum-product networks (SSPNs), an extension of SPNs in which sum-node weights are defined by a submodular energy function. SSPNs combine the expressivity and depth of SPNs with the ability to efficiently compute the MAP state of a combinatorial number of labelings afforded by submodular energies. SSPNs for scene understanding can be understood as representing all possible parses of an image over arbitrary region shapes with respect to an image grammar. Despite this, we develop an efficient and convergent algorithm based on graph cuts for computing the (approximate) MAP state of an SSPN in time sub-linear in the network size, greatly increasing the expressivity of the SPN model class. Empirically, we show exponential improvements in parsing time compared to traditional scene-understanding algorithms such as alpha-expansion and belief propagation, while returning comparable minima."
Incorporating long-range consistency in CNN-based texture generation,"Gatys et al. (2015) showed that pair-wise products of features in a convolutional network are a very effective representation of image textures. We propose a simple modification to that representation which makes it possible to incorporate long-range structure into image generation, and to render images that satisfy various symmetry constraints. We show how this can greatly improve rendering of regular textures and of images that contain other kinds of symmetric structure. We also present applications to inpainting and season transfer."
Human perception in computer vision,"Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates, while sensitivity to shape and contrast has DNN end-computation correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical view that properties of human perception are a consequence of architecture-independent visual learning."
Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism,"Encoder-decoder models have been widely used to solve sequence to sequence prediction tasks. However current approaches suffer from two shortcomings. First, the encoders compute a representation of each word taking into account only the history of the words it has read so far, yielding suboptimal representations. Second, current decoders utilize large vocabularies in order to minimize the problem of unknown words, resulting in slow decoding times. In this paper we address both shortcomings. Towards this goal, we first introduce a simple mechanism that first reads the input sequence before committing to a representation of each word.  Furthermore, we propose a simple copy mechanism that is able to exploit very small vocabularies and handle out-of-vocabulary words. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Gigaword dataset and DUC competition outperforming the state-of-the-art."
Layer Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this paper, 
we propose a Layer-RNN (L-RNN) network that is able to learn contextual information adaptively using within-layer recurrence.
Our contributions are three-fold:
(i) we propose a hybrid neural network architecture that interleaves
traditional convolutional layers with Layer-RNN for modelling long-range dependencies;
(ii) we show that a Layer-RNN can be seamlessly inserted into any convolutional layer of a pre-trained CNN, 
and the entire network then fine-tuned, leading to a boost in performance;
(iii) we report experiments on the CIFAR-10 classification task reaching 5.7% top1 error; 
and for image segmentation, 
we start with a pre-trained FCN VGG-16 network, 
and show that its performance on the PASCAL VOC2012 semantic segmentation task can be boosted by 5% (mean IOU) by simply inserting Layer-RNNs."
Dynamic Coattention Networks For Question Answering,"Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. How- ever, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointer decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1."
SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model,"In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time. We show that our model which profits from combining memory-less modules, namely autoregressive multilayer perceptron, and stateful recurrent neural networks in a hierarchical structure is de facto powerful to capture the underlying sources of variations in temporal domain for very long time on three datasets of different nature. Human evaluation on the generated samples indicate that our model is preferred over competing models. We also show how each component of the model contributes to the exhibited performance."
Metacontrol for Adaptive Imagination-Based Optimization,"Many machine learning systems are built to solve the hardest examples of a particular task, which often makes them large and expensive to run---especially with respect to the easier examples, which might require much less computation. For an agent with a limited computational budget, this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may result in the agent wasting valuable computation on easy examples, while not spending enough on hard examples. Rather than learning a single, fixed policy for solving all instances of a task, we introduce a metacontroller which learns to optimize a sequence of ""imagined"" internal simulations over predictive models of the world in order to construct a more informed, and more economical, solution. The metacontroller component is a model-free reinforcement learning agent, which decides both how many iterations of the optimization procedure to run, as well as which model to consult on each iteration. The models (which we call ""experts"") can be state transition models, action-value functions, or any other mechanism that provides information useful for solving the task, and can be learned on-policy or off-policy in parallel with the metacontroller. When the metacontroller, controller, and experts were trained with ""interaction networks"" (Battaglia et al., 2016) as expert models, our approach was able to solve a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics. The metacontroller learned to adapt the amount of computation it performed to the difficulty of the task, and learned how to choose which experts to consult by factoring in both their reliability and individual computational resource costs. This allowed the metacontroller to achieve a lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than more traditional fixed policy approaches. These results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful framework for using rich forward models for efficient model-based reinforcement learning."
Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used to solve a variety of problems and as the quantity of data and the amount of available compute have increased, so have model sizes. The number of parameters in recent state-of-the-art networks makes them hard to deploy, especially on mobile phones and embedded devices. The challenge is due to both the size of the model and the time it takes to evaluate it. In order to deploy these RNNs efficiently, we propose a technique to reduce the parameters of a network by pruning weights during the initial training of the network. At the end of training, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still close to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8× and the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while still reducing the total number of parameters significantly. Pruning RNNs reduces the size of the model and can also help achieve significant inference time speed-up using sparse GEMMs. Benchmarks show that using our technique model size can be reduced by 90% and speed-up is around 2× to 7×."
Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images."
Gaussian Attention Model and Its Application to Knowledge Base Embedding and Question Answering,"We propose the Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory
access. With the proposed attention model, a neural network has the
additional degree of freedom to control the focus of its attention from
a laser sharp attention to a broad attention. It is applicable whenever
we can assume that the distance in the latent space reflects some notion
of semantics. We use the proposed attention model as a scoring function
for the embedding of a knowledge base into a continuous vector space and
then train a model that performs question answering about the entities
in the knowledge base. The proposed attention model can handle both the
propagation of uncertainty when following a series of relations and also
the conjunction of conditions in a natural way. On a dataset of soccer
players who participated in the FIFA World Cup 2014, we demonstrate that
our model can handle both path queries and conjunctive queries well."
Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks,"This paper studies the cooperative training of two probabilistic models of signals such as images. Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first network is a descriptor network, which is an exponential family model or an energy-based model, whose feature statistics or energy function are defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed signal to the feature statistics. The second network is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed signal. The maximum likelihood training algorithms of both the descriptor net and the generator net are in the form of alternating back-propagation, and both algorithms involve Langevin sampling. We observe that the two training algorithms can cooperate with each other by jumpstarting each other's Langevin sampling, and they can be seamlessly interwoven into a CoopNets algorithm that can train both nets simultaneously."
Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks,"Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\times$ and averaging 87\% expert human performance on Labyrinth."
Exploring LOTS in Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks have recently demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks. Despite recent advances, our understanding of these learning models is still incomplete, at least, as their unexpected vulnerability to imperceptibly small, non-random perturbations revealed. The existence of these so-called adversarial examples presents a serious problem of the application of vulnerable machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce the layerwise origin-target synthesis (LOTS) that can serve multiple purposes. First, we can use it as a visualization technique that gives us insights into the function of any intermediate feature layer by showing the notion of a particular input in deep neural networks. Second, our approach can be applied to assess the invariance of the learned features captured at any layer with respect to the class of the particular input. Finally, it can also be utilized as a general way for producing a vast amount of diverse adversarial examples that can be used for training to further improve the robustness of machine learning models and their performance as well."
Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images. However, translation is just one of a myriad of useful spatial transformations. Can the same efficiency be attained when considering other spatial invariances?
Such generalized convolutions have been considered in the past, but at a high computational cost. We present a construction that is simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes.
With a carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be made invariant to one of a wide range of spatial transformations. We show encouraging results in realistic scenarios, including the estimation of vehicle poses in the Google Earth dataset (rotation and scale), and face poses in Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (3D rotations under perspective)."
Adjusting for Dropout Variance in Batch Normalization and Weight Initialization,"We show how to adjust for the variance introduced by dropout with corrections to weight initialization and Batch Normalization, yielding higher accuracy. Though dropout can preserve the expected input to a neuron between train and test, the variance of the input differs. We thus propose a new weight initialization by correcting for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's influence on variance through simple corrective scalars. Since Batch Normalization trained with dropout estimates the variance of a layer's incoming distribution with some inputs dropped, the variance also differs between train and test. After training a network with Batch Normalization and dropout, we simply update Batch Normalization's variance moving averages with dropout off and obtain state of the art on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 without data augmentation."
Song From PI: A Musically Plausible Network for Pop Music Generation,"We present a novel framework for generating pop music. Our model is a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, where the layers and the structure of the hierarchy encode our prior knowledge about how pop music is composed. In particular, the bottom layers generate the melody, while the higher levels produce the drums and chords. We conduct several human studies that show strong preference of our generated music over that produced by the recent method by Google. We additionally show two applications of our framework: neural dancing and karaoke, as well as neural story singing."
Rule Mining in Feature Space,"Relational embeddings have emerged as an excellent tool for inferring novel facts
from partially observed knowledge bases. Recently, it was shown that some
classes of embeddings can also be exploited to perform a simplified form of rule
mining. By interpreting logical conjunction as a form of composition between re-
lation embeddings, simplified logical theories can be mined directly in the space
of latent representations. In this paper, we present a method to mine full-fledged
logical theories, which are significantly more expressive, by casting the semantics
of the logical operators to the space of the embeddings. In order to extract relevant
rules in the space of relation compositions we borrow sparse reconstruction pro-
cedures from the field of compressed sensing. Our empirical analysis showcases
the advantages of our approach."
Learning to Discover Sparse Graphical Models,"We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. In the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) a popular estimator is a maximum likelihood objective with a penalization on the precision matrix. Adapting this estimator to capture domain-specific knowledge as priors or a new data likelihood requires great effort. In addition, structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function mapping from empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures.  Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. We apply this framework to several real-world problems in structure discovery and show that it can be competitive to standard approaches such as graphical lasso, at a fraction of the execution speed. We use convolutional neural networks to parametrize our estimators due to the compositional structure of the problem. Experimentally, our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well to different data: identifying relevant edges in real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain competitive(and generally superior) performance, compared with analytical
methods. "
Structured Attention Networks,"Attention networks have proven to be an effective approach for embedding categorical inference within a deep neural network. However, for many tasks we may want to model richer structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. In this work, we experiment with incorporating richer structural distributions, encoded using graphical models, within deep networks. We show that these structured attention networks are simple extensions of the basic attention procedure, and that they allow for extending attention beyond the standard soft-selection approach, such as attending to partial segmentations or to subtrees. We experiment with two different classes of structured attention networks: a linear-chain conditional random field and a graph-based parsing model, and describe how these models can be practically implemented as neural network layers. Experiments show that this approach is effective for incorporating structural biases, and structured attention networks outperform baseline attention models on a variety of synthetic and real tasks: tree transduction, neural machine translation, and natural language inference. We further find that models trained in this way learn interesting unsupervised hidden representations that generalize simple attention."
Zoneout: Regularizing RNNs by Randomly Preserving Hidden Activations,"We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs.
At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values.
Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization.
But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks.
We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks. We achieve competitive results with relatively simple models in character- and word-level language modelling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and combining with recurrent batch normalization yields state-of-the-art results on permuted sequential MNIST."
Deep Probabilistic Programming,"We propose Edward, a new Turing-complete probabilistic programming language which builds on two compositional representations—random variables and inference. We show how to integrate our language into existing computational graph frameworks such as TensorFlow; this provides significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. We also show how Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation, to variational inference, to MCMC. By treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as computationally efficient and flexible as traditional deep learning. For flexibility, we show how to reuse the modeling representation within inference to design rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, we show that our implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is 35x faster than hand-optimized software such as Stan."
Learning to Draw Samples: With Application to Amortized MLE for Generative Adversarial Learning,"We propose a simple algorithm to train stochastic neural networks to draw samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference. Our method is based on iteratively adjusting the neural network parameters so that the output changes along a Stein variational gradient that maximumly decreases the KL divergence with the target distribution. Our method works for any target distribution specified by their unnormalized density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. As an application of our method, we propose an amortized MLE algorithm for training deep energy model, where a neural sampler is adaptively trained to approximate the likelihood function. Our method mimics an adversarial game between the deep energy model and the neural sampler, and obtains realistic-looking images competitive with the state-of-the-art results."
The Power of Sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks,"Deep convolutional networks are well-known for their high computational and memory demands. Given limited resources, how does one design a network that balances its size, training time, and prediction accuracy? A surprisingly effective approach to trade accuracy for size and speed is to simply reduce the number of channels in each convolutional layer by a fixed fraction and retrain the network. In many cases this leads to significantly smaller networks with only minimal changes to accuracy. In this paper, we take a step further by empirically examining a strategy for deactivating connections between filters in convolutional layers in a way that allows us to harvest savings both in run-time and memory for many network architectures. More specifically, we generalize 2D convolution to use a channel-wise sparse connection structure and show that this leads to significantly better results than the baseline approach for large networks including VGG and Inception V3."
Multi-view Generative Adversarial Networks,"Learning over multi-view data is a challenging problem with strong practical applications. Most related studies focus on the classification point of view and assume that all the views are available at any time. We consider an extension of this framework in two directions. First, based on the BiGAN model, the Multi-view BiGAN (MV-BiGAN) is able to perform density estimation from multi-view inputs. Second, it can deal with missing views and is able to update its prediction when additional views are provided. We illustrate these properties on a set of experiments over different datasets."
LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"We present LR-GAN: an adversarial image generation model which takes scene structure and context into account. Unlike previous generative adversarial networks (GANs), the proposed GAN learns to generate image background and foregrounds separately and recursively, and stitch the foregrounds on the backgrounds in a contextually relevant manner to produce a complete natural image. For each foreground, the model learns to generate its appearance, location and shape. The whole model is unsupervised, and is trained in an end-to-end manner with conventional gradient descent methods. The experiments demonstrate that our model can generate more natural images with objects that are more human recognizable than baseline GAN models. "
Beyond Bilingual: Multi-sense Word Embeddings using Multilingual Context,"Word embeddings, which represent a word as a point in a vector space, have become ubiquitous to several NLP tasks. A recent line of work uses bilingual (two languages) corpora to learn a different vector for each sense of a word, by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense identification. We present a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm which improves multi-sense word embeddings by (a) using multilingual (i.e., more than two languages) corpora to significantly improve sense embeddings beyond what one achieves with bilingual information, and (b) uses a principled approach to learn a variable number of senses per word, in a data-driven manner. Ours is the first approach with the ability to leverage multilingual corpora efficiently for multi-sense representation learning. Experiments show that multilingual training significantly improves performance over monolingual and bilingual training, by allowing us to combine different parallel corpora to leverage multilingual context. Multilingual training yields com- parable performance to a state of the art monolingual model trained on five times more training data."
Two Methods for Wild Variational Inference,"Variational inference provides a powerful tool for approximate probabilistic inference on complex, structured models. Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable probability density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of variational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD to maximize its convergence speed, significantly outperforming the hand-designed step size schemes."
Recurrent Normalization Propagation,"We propose a LSTM parametrization  that preserves the means and variances of the hidden states and memory cells across time. While having training benefits similar to Recurrent Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, it does not need to estimate statistics at each time step,  therefore, requiring fewer computations overall. We also investigate the parametrization impact on the gradient flows and  present a way of initializing the weights accordingly.

We evaluate our proposal on language modelling and image generative modelling tasks. We empirically show that it performs similarly or better than other recurrent normalization approaches, while being faster to execute."
Variational Lossy Autoencoder,"Representation learning seeks to expose certain aspects of observed data in a learned representation that's amenable to downstream tasks like classification. 
For instance, a good representation for 2D images might be one that describes only global structure and discards information about detailed texture. 
In this paper, we present a simple but principled method to learn such global representations by combining Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with neural autoregressive models such as RNN, MADE and PixelRNN/CNN. 
Our proposed VAE model allows us to have control over what the global latent code can learn and , by designing the architecture accordingly, we can force the global latent code to discard irrelevant information such as texture in 2D images, and hence the code only ``autoencodes'' data in a lossy fashion.
In addition, by leveraging autoregressive models as both prior distribution $p(z)$ and decoding distribution $p(x|z)$, we can greatly improve generative modeling performance of VAEs, achieving new state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 Silhouettes density estimation tasks.  
"
A recurrent neural network without chaos,"We introduce an exceptionally simple  gated recurrent neural network (RNN)  that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. We prove that our model has simple, predicable and non-chaotic dynamics. This stands in stark contrast to more standard gated architectures, whose underlying dynamical systems exhibit chaotic behavior."
Rethinking Numerical Representations for Deep Neural Networks,"With ever-increasing computational demand for deep learning, it is critical to investigate the implications of the numeric representation and precision of DNN model weights and activations on computational efficiency. In this work, we explore unconventional narrow-precision floating-point representations as it relates to inference accuracy and efficiency to steer the improved design of future DNN platforms.  We show that inference using these custom numeric representations on production-grade DNNs, including GoogLeNet and VGG, achieves an average speedup of 7.6x with less than 1% degradation in inference accuracy relative to a state-of-the-art baseline platform representing the most sophisticated hardware using single-precision floating point.  To facilitate the use of such customized precision, we also present a novel technique that drastically reduces the time required to derive the optimal precision configuration."
NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model’s architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the “neuronal birth” is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. “Neuronal death” is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements."
 Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer,"The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters.  In this work, we present a new kind of layer, the Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used to effectively increase model capacity with only a modest increase in computation. This layer consists of up to tens of thousands of feed-forward sub-networks (experts) containing a total of up to tens of billions of parameters.  A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example.  We apply the MoE to the task of language modeling, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of world knowledge available in the training corpora.  We present new language model architectures where an MoE layer is inserted between stacked LSTMs, resulting in models with orders of magnitude more parameters than would otherwise be feasible. On language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, we achieve comparable or better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost, including test perplexity of 29.9 on the 1 Billion Word Language Modeling Benchmark and BLEU scores of 40.56  and 26.03 on the WMT'14 En to Fr and En to De datasets respectively."
Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence Models,"Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data. Equally ubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference algorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search space in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top B candidates. This tends to result in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing lists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but also typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To overcome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing a diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method not only improved diversity but also finds better top 1 solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search space. Moreover, these gains are achieved with minimal computational or memory overhead com- pared to beam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present results on image captioning, machine translation, conversation and visual question generation using both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies. We find that our method consistently outperforms BS and previously proposed techniques for diverse decoding from neural sequence models."
Tree-structured decoding with doubly-recurrent neural networks,"We propose a neural network architecture for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The core of the method is a doubly-recurrent neural network that models separately the width and depth recurrences across the tree, and combines them inside each cell to generate an output. The topology of the tree is explicitly modeled, allowing the network to predict both content and topology of the tree when decoding. That is, given only an encoded vector representation, the network is able to simultaneously generate a tree from it and predict labels for the nodes. We test this architecture in an encoder-decoder framework, where we train a network to encode a sentence as a vector, and then generate a tree structure from it. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this architecture at recovering latent tree structure in sequences and at mapping sentences to simple functional programs."
Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis,"We present Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA) -- a method for learning nonlinear transformations of arbitrarily many views of data, such that the resulting transformations are maximally informative of each other.  While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags or friends to Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques."
Introspection:Accelerating Neural Network Training By Learning Weight Evolution,"Neural Networks are function approximators that have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in numerous machine learning tasks. In spite of their great success in terms of accuracy, their large training time makes it difficult to use them for various tasks. In this paper, we explore the idea of learning weight evolution pattern from a simple network for   accelerating training of novel neural networks. This method can also be used with other optimizers to give faster convergence.
       We learn the training pattern from MNIST classification and utilize it to accelerate training of neural networks used for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification. The results indicates a general trend in the weight evolution during training of any neural network."
Hyperband: Bandit-Based Configuration Evaluation for Hyperparameter Optimization,"Performance of machine learning algorithms depends critically on identifying a good set of hyperparameters.  While current methods offer efficiencies by adaptively choosing new configurations to train, an alternative strategy is to adaptively allocate resources across the selected configurations.  We formulate hyperparameter optimization as an infinitely many-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource, e.g., iterations, data samples or number of features, is allocated to randomly sampled configurations.  We introduce Hyperband for this framework, and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on several hyperparameter optimization problems.  We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order of magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization algorithms on a variety of neural network and kernel-based learning problems.  "
A Context-aware Attention Network for Interactive Question Answering,"We develop a new end-to-end model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using Gated-Recurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models."
Lie-Access Neural Turing Machines,"  Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of employing explicit
  external memory structures in conjunction with deep neural models
  for algorithmic learning (Graves et al. 2014; Weston et al. 2014).  These models utilize
  differentiable versions of traditional discrete memory-access
  structures (random access, stacks, tapes) to provide the
  variable-length storage necessary for computational tasks.  In this
  work, we propose an alternative model, Lie-access memory, that is
  explicitly designed for the neural setting. In this paradigm, memory is
  accessed using a continuous head in a key-space manifold. The head
  is moved via Lie group actions, such as shifts or rotations,
  generated by a controller, and soft memory access is performed by considering the
  distance to keys associated with each memory. We argue that Lie
  groups provide a natural generalization of discrete memory
  structures, such as Turing machines, as they provide inverse and
  identity operators while maintain differentiability. To experiment
  with this approach, we implement several simplified Lie-access neural
  Turing machine (LANTM) with different Lie groups.
  We find that this approach is able to
  perform well on several algorithmic experiments, and outperforms
  RNN-based methods."
Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep’s computation on the previous timestep’s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences. We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels. Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size. Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time. Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks."
Recurrent Environment Simulators,"Agent-based systems require multiple mechanisms with which to understand their environments. One such mechanism is the ability to imagine and deliberate upon the effect of their actions on the environment. To equip agents with this ability, we develop a system that allows accurate models of an environment to be learned, and use this model to simulate the future evolution of the environment. We introduce an action-conditional recurrent neural network that addresses three shortcomings of existing approaches: actions in our model affect transition dynamics directly; our model is able to make spatially and temporally coherent, high-dimensional image predictions for hundreds of steps into the future; our model can make future predictions of the environment without needing to generate all intermediate observations. We show that the same model is adaptable to many diverse environments, namely complex 3D mazes, 3D racing car simulators, and at least ten Atari games. We also show that our model can be used to improve exploration in complex maze environments."
Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems,"Inverse problems are typically solved by first defining a model and then choosing an inference procedure. With this separation of modeling from inference, inverse problems can be framed in a modular way. For example, variational inference can be applied to a broad class of models. The modularity, however, typically goes away after model parameters have been trained under a chosen inference procedure. During training, model and inference often interact in a way that the model parameters will ultimately be adapted to the chosen inference procedure, posing the two components inseparable after training. But if model and inference become inseperable after training, why separate them in the first place?

We propose a novel learning framework which abandons the dichotomy between model and inference. Instead, we introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that directly learn to solve inverse problems.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks. We show empirically that RIMs exhibit the desirable convergence behavior of classical inference procedures, and that they can outperform state-of- the-art methods when trained on specialized inference tasks.

Our approach bridges the gap between inverse problems and deep learning, providing a framework for fast progression in the field of inverse problems."
EPOpt: Learning Robust Neural Network Policies Using Model Ensembles,"Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks, especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks. Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from the target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning."
Semi-Supervised Learning with Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"We introduce a simple semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. Images with random patches removed are presented to a generator whose task is to fill in the hole, based on the surrounding pixels. The in-painted images are then presented to a discriminator network that judges if they are real (unaltered training images) or not. This task acts as a regularizer for standard supervised training of the discriminator. Using our approach we are able to directly train large VGG-style networks in a semi-supervised fashion. We evaluate on STL-10 and PASCAL datasets, where our approach obtains performance comparable or superior to existing methods.

"Attend, Adapt and Transfer: Attentive Deep Architecture for Adaptive Transfer from multiple sources in the same domain","Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain."
Investigating Different Context Types and Representations for Learning Word Embeddings,"The number of word embedding models is growing every year. Most of them learn word embeddings based on the co-occurrence information of words and their context. However, it's still an open question what is the best definition of context. We provide the first systematical investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different context under 9 datasets, which give us some insights about context selection. We hope that this paper, along with the published code, can serve as a guideline of choosing context for our community.
"
Multi-view Recurrent Neural Acoustic Word Embeddings,"Recent work has begun exploring neural acoustic word embeddings–fixed dimensional vector representations of arbitrary-length speech segments corresponding to words. Such embeddings are applicable to speech retrieval and recognition tasks, where reasoning about whole words may make it possible to avoid ambiguous sub-word representations. The main idea is to map acoustic sequences to fixed-dimensional vectors such that examples of the same word are mapped to similar vectors, while different-word examples are mapped to very different vectors. In this work we take a multi-view approach to learning acoustic word embeddings, in which we jointly learn to embed acoustic sequences and their corresponding character sequences. We use deep bidirectional LSTM embedding models and multi-view contrastive losses. We study the effect of different loss variants, including fixed-margin and cost-sensitive losses. Our acoustic word embeddings improve over previous approaches for the task of word discrimination. We also present results on other tasks that are enabled by the multi-view approach, including cross-view word discrimination and word similarity."
Learning Features of Music From Scratch,"We introduce a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source
of supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research.
MusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings
by 10 composers, written for 10 instruments, together with instrument/note
annotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber
music performances under various studio and microphone conditions.

We define a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings,
along with an evaluation protocol. We benchmark several machine learning
architectures for this task:

i) learning from ``hand-crafted'' spectrogram features;
ii) end-to-end learning with a neural net;
iii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net.

We show that several end-to-end learning proposals outperform approaches
based on learning from hand-crafted audio features."
The Predictron: End-To-End Learning and Planning,"One of the key challenges of artificial intelligence is to learn models that are effective in the context of planning. In this document we introduce the predictron architecture. The predictron consists of an abstract model, formulated as a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple steps. At every step it outputs predictions about the future, formulated as value functions. The predictron is trained end-to-end directly from experience to make these value functions accurate, thereby focusing the model upon the aspects of the environment most relevant to planning. During training, we can exploit the Markov semantics of our model to make the value functions consistent both with the real environment and with each other. We applied our architecture to procedurally generated random mazes and a simulator for the game of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural network architectures."
Generating Interpretable Images with Controllable Structure,"We demonstrate improved text-to-image synthesis with controllable object locations using an extension of Pixel Convolutional Neural Networks (PixelCNN). In addition to conditioning on text, we show how the model can generate images conditioned on part keypoints and segmentation masks. The character-level text encoder and image generation network are jointly trained end-to-end via maximum likelihood. We establish quantitative baselines in terms of text and structure-conditional pixel log-likelihood for three data sets: Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB), MPII Human Pose (MHP), and Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO)."
Bridging Nonlinearities and Stochastic Regularizers with Gaussian Error Linear Units,"We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural network activation function. The GELU nonlinearity is the expected transformation of a stochastic regularizer which randomly applies the identity or zero map. This new stochastic regularizer is comparable to nonlinearities aided by dropout, and it removes the need for a traditional nonlinearity. The connection between the GELU and the stochastic regularizer suggests a new probabilistic understanding of nonlinearities. We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all tasks."
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks,"The storage and computation requirements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be prohibitive for exploiting these models over low-power or embedded devices. This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs by minimizing an objective function, including the recognition loss that is augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance, which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of the separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models, our proposed method is able to simplify the original model, generating models with less computation and fewer parameters, while maintaining and often improving generalization performance. Accomplishments on a variety of models strongly verify that our proposed ADMM-based method can be a very useful tool for simplifying and improving deep CNNs. "
A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks,"We consider the two related problems of detecting if an example is misclassified or out-of-distribution. We present a simple baseline that utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions. Correctly classified examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these underexplored detection tasks."
Inefficiency of stochastic gradient descent with larger mini-batches (and more learners),"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are the most important optimization algorithms used in large scale machine learning. Mini-batch version of stochastic gradient is often used in practice for taking advantage of hardware parallelism. In this work, we analyze the effect of mini-batch size over SGD convergence for the case of general non-convex objective functions. Building on the past analyses, we justify mathematically that there can often be a large difference between the convergence guarantees provided by small and large mini-batches (given each instance processes equal number of training samples), while providing experimental evidence for the same. Going further to distributed settings, we show that an analogous effect holds with popular Asynchronous Gradient Descent (\asgd): there can be a large difference between convergence guarantees with increasing number of learners given that the cumulative number of training samples processed remains the same. Thus there is an inherent (and similar) inefficiency introduced in the convergence behavior when we attempt to take advantage of parallelism, either by increasing mini-batch size or by increase the number of learners."
Learning to superoptimize programs,"  Code super-optimization is the task of transforming any given program to a more efficient version while preserving its input-output behaviour. In some sense, it is similar to the paraphrase problem from natural language processing where the intention is to change the syntax of an utterance without changing its semantics. Code-optimization has been the subject of years of research that has resulted in the development of rule-based transformation strategies that are used by compilers. More recently, however, a class of stochastic search based methods have been shown to outperform these strategies. This approach involves repeated sampling of modifications to the program from a proposal distribution, which are accepted or rejected based on whether they preserve correctness, and the improvement they achieve. These methods, however, neither learn from past behaviour nor do they try to leverage the semantics of the program under consideration. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel learning based approach for code super-optimization. Intuitively, our method works by learning the proposal distribution using unbiased estimators of the gradient of the expected improvement. Experiments on benchmarks comprising of automatically generated as well as existing (``Hacker's Delight'') programs show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform state of the art approaches for code super-optimization.

The Variational Walkback Algorithm,"A recognized obstacle to training undirected graphical models with latent variables such as Boltzmann machines is that the maximum likelihood training procedure requires sampling from Monte-Carlo Markov chains which may not mix well, in the inner loop of training, for each example.  We first propose the idea that it is sufficient to locally carve the energy function everywhere so that its gradient points in the ""right"" direction (i.e., towards generating the data). Following on previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, generative stochastic networks and unsupervised learning using non-equilibrium dynamics, we propose a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data which corresponds to a new learning procedure that first walks away from data points by following the model transition operator and then trains that operator to walk backwards for each of these steps, back towards the training example. The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator. This also eliminates the explicit need for symmetric weights which previous Boltzmann machine or Hopfield net models require, and which makes these models less biologically plausible."
Distributed Transfer Learning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Basic Probability Assignment,"Transfer learning is a highly popular practice in deep neural networks but fine-tuning of large number of parameters is a hard challenge due to the complex wiring of neurons between splitting layers and imbalance class coverage among original and transferred domains. Recent advances in evidence theory show that in an imbalance multiclass learning problem, optimizing of proper objective functions based on contingency tables prevents biases towards high-prior classes. Transfer learning usually deal with highly non-convex objectives and local minima in deep neural architectures. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed transfer learning for tackling of the optimization complexity and class-imbalance problem jointly. Our framework imposes a greedy regularization to each convolutional filter separately and makes the minority classes perform as the majority ones. We employing basic probability assignment of evidence theory to boost distributed transfer learners and improve overall performance of the transferred domains. We conduct our experiments on several standard datasets to confirm the consistent improvement of our distributed transfer learning strategy."
Trusting SVM for Piecewise Linear CNNs,"We present a novel layerwise optimization algorithm for the learning objective of a large class of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we consider CNNs that employ piecewise linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the problem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. To this end, we extend the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm in three important ways: (i) we include a trust-region for the parameters, which allows us to use the previous parameters as an initialization; (ii) we reduce the memory requirement of BCFW by several orders of magnitude for the dense layers, which enables us to learn a large set of parameters; and (iii) we observe that, empirically, the optimal solution of the structured SVM problem can be obtained efficiently by solving a related, but significantly easier, multi-class SVM problem. Using publicly available data sets, we show that our approach outperforms the state of the art variants of backpropagation, and is also more robust to the hyperparameters of the learning objective."
A hybrid network: Scattering and Convnet,"This paper shows how, by combining prior and supervised representations, one can create architectures that lead to nearly state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks, which mean they perform as well as a deep network learned from scratch. We use scattering as a generic and fixed initialization of the first layers of a deep network, and learn the remaining layers in a supervised manner. We numerically demonstrate that deep hybrid scattering networks generalize better on small datasets than supervised deep networks. Scattering networks could help current systems to save computation time, while guaranteeing the stability  to geometric transformations and noise of the first internal layers. We also show that the learned operators explicitly build invariances to geometrical variabilities, such as local rotation and translation, by analyzing the third layer of our architecture.  We demonstrate that it is possible to replace the scattering transform by a standard deep network at the cost of having to learn more parameters and potentially adding instabilities. Finally, we release a new software, ScatWave, using GPUs for fast computations of a scattering network that is integrated in Torch. We evaluate our model on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets."
FastText.zip: Compressing text classification models,"We consider the problem of producing compact architectures for text classification, such that the full model fits in a limited amount of memory.  After considering different solutions inspired by the hashing literature, we propose a method built upon product quantization to store the word embeddings.  While the original technique leads to a loss in accuracy,  we adapt this method to circumvent the quantization artifacts. As a result, our approach produces a text classifier, derived from the fastText approach, which at test time requires only a fraction of the memory compared to the original one, without noticeably sacrificing the quality in terms of classification accuracy. Our experiments carried out on several benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude less memory than fastText while being only slightly inferior with respect to accuracy. As a result, it outperforms the state of the art by a good margin in terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy."
Fast Chirplet Transform Enhances CNN-based Audio Classifier on Small Data,"Advanced soundscape analysis or machine listening are requiring efficient time frequency decompositions. The recent scattering theory is offering a robust hierarchical convolutional decomposition, nevertheless its kernels need to be fixed. Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) can be seen as the optimal kernel decomposition, nevertheless it requires large amount of training data. This paper shows that Chirplet kernels are providing good constant Q time-frequency representation which yields to better CNN classification than usual acoustic representation. The contributions are (1) to motivate Chirplet bioinspired auditory representation. (2) We define the first algorithm of Fast Chirplet Transform (FCT). (3) We validate FCT on environmental recordings of orca and birds. (4) We show that FCT improves CNN classification of complex overlapping bird calls on small data per species LifeClef Challenge. (5) We demonstrate on the same benchmark that pretraining on FCT representation of the low level layers of the CNN accelerates its convergence by 28\%, while it yields to 8\% relative gain of Mean Average Precision"
Sigma Delta Quantized Networks,"Deep neural networks can be obscenely wasteful. When processing video, a convolutional network expends a fixed amount of computation for each frame with no regard to the similarity between neighbouring frames. As a result, it ends up repeatedly doing very similar computations. To put an end to such waste, we introduce Sigma-Delta networks. With each new input, each layer in this network sends a discretized form of its change in activation to the next layer. Thus the amount of computation that the network does scales with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. We introduce an optimization method for converting any pre-trained deep network into an optimally efficient Sigma-Delta network, and show that our algorithm, if run on the appropriate hardware, could cut at least an order of magnitude from the computational cost of processing video data.

Encoding and Decoding Representations with Sum- and Max-Product Networks,"Sum-Product networks (SPNs) are expressive deep architectures for representing probability distributions, yet allowing exact and efficient inference. SPNs have been successfully applied in several domains, however always as black-box distribution estimators. In this paper, we argue that due to their recursive definition, SPNs can also be naturally employed as hierarchical feature extractors and thus for unsupervised representation learning. Moreover, when converted into Max-Product Networks (MPNs), it is possible to decode such representations back into the original input space. In this way, MPNs can be interpreted as a kind of generative autoencoder, even if they were never trained to reconstruct the input data. We show how these learned representations, if visualized, indeed correspond to ""meaningful parts"" of the training data. They also yield a large improvement when used in structured prediction tasks. As shown in extensive experiments, SPN and MPN encoding and decoding schemes prove very competitive  against the ones employing RBMs and other stacked autoencoder architectures."
A SELF-ATTENTIVE SENTENCE EMBEDDING,"This paper proposes a new model for extracting an interpretable sentence embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a 2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on a different part of the sentence. We also propose a self-attention mechanism and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification and textual entailment. Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks."
Regularizing CNNs with Locally Constrained Decorrelations,"Regularization is key for deep learning since it allows training more complex models while keeping lower levels of overfitting. However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated features, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. 
In particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space. As a result, we are able to reduce the overfitting of state-of-the-art CNNs on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN."
Maximum Entropy Flow Networks,"Maximum entropy modeling is a flexible and popular framework for formulating statistical models given partial knowledge. In this paper, rather than the traditional method of optimizing over the continuous density directly, we learn a smooth and invertible transformation that maps a simple distribution to the desired maximum entropy distribution. Doing so is non-trivial in that the objective being maximized (entropy) is a function of the density itself.  By exploiting recent developments in normalizing flow networks, we cast the maximum entropy problem into a finite-dimensional constrained optimization, and solve the problem by combining stochastic optimization with the augmented Lagrangian method. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and an application to predicting equity option prices shows the flexibility and accuracy of using maximum entropy flow networks."
Symmetry-Breaking Convergence Analysis of Certain Two-layered Neural Networks with ReLU nonlinearity,"In this paper, we use dynamical system to analyze the nonlinear weight dynamics of two-layered bias-free networks in the form of $g(x; w) = \sum_{j=1}^K \sigma(w_j \cdot x)$, where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is ReLU nonlinearity. We assume that the input $x$ follow Gaussian distribution. The network is trained using gradient descent to mimic the output of a teacher network of the same size with fixed parameters $w*$ using $l_2$ loss. We first show that when $K = 1$, the nonlinear dynamics can be written in close form, and converges to $w*$ with at least $(1-\epsilon)/2$ probability, if random weight initializations of proper standard derivation ($\sim 1/\sqrt{d}$) is used, verifying empirical practice. For networks with many ReLU nodes ($K \ge 2$), we apply our close form dynamics and prove that when the teacher parameters $\{w*_j\}_{j=1}^K$ forms orthonormal bases, (1) a symmetric weight initialization yields a convergence to a saddle point and (2) a certain symmetry-breaking weight initialization yields global convergence to $w*$ without local minima. To our knowledge, this is the first proof that shows global convergence in nonlinear neural network without unrealistic assumptions on the independence of ReLU activations. In addition, we also give a concise gradient update formulation for a multilayer ReLU network when it follows a teacher of the same size with $l_2$ loss. Simulations verify our theoretical analysis."
Sequence to Sequence Transduction with Hard Monotonic Attention,"We present a supervised sequence to sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism which combines the more traditional statistical alignment methods with the power of recurrent neural networks. We evaluate the model on the task of morphological inflection generation and show that it provides state of the art results in various setups compared to the previous neural and non-neural approaches. Eventually we present an analysis of the learned representations for both hard and soft attention models, shedding light on the features such models extract in order to solve the task."
Improving Stochastic Gradient Descent with Feedback,"In this paper we propose a simple and efficient method for improving stochastic gradient descent methods by using feedback from the objective function. The method tracks the relative changes in the objective function with a running average, and uses it to adaptively tune the learning rate in stochastic gradient descent. We specifically apply this idea to modify Adam, a popular algorithm for training deep neural networks. We conduct experiments to compare the resulting algorithm, which we call Eve, with state of the art methods used for training deep learning models. We train CNNs for image classification, and RNNs for language modeling and question answering. Our experiments show that Eve outperforms all other algorithms on these benchmark tasks. We also analyze the behavior of the feedback mechanism during the training process.

The Concrete Distribution: A Continuous Relaxation of Discrete Random Variables,"The reparameterization trick enables optimizing large scale stochastic computation graphs via gradient descent. The essence of the trick is to refactor each stochastic node into a differentiable function of its parameters and a random variable with fixed distribution. After refactoring, the gradients of the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance unbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss. While many continuous random variables have such reparameterizations, discrete random variables lack continuous reparameterizations due to the discontinuous nature of discrete states. In this work we introduce concrete random variables -- continuous relaxations of discrete random variables. The concrete distribution is a new family of distributions with closed form densities and a simple reparameterization. Whenever a discrete stochastic node of a computation graph can be refactored into a one-hot bit representation that is treated continuously, concrete stochastic nodes can be used with automatic differentiation to produce low-variance biased gradients of objectives (including objectives that depend on the log-probability of latent stochastic nodes) on the corresponding discrete graph. We demonstrate effectiveness of concrete relaxations on density estimation and structured prediction tasks using neural networks."
Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs,"Label propagation is a powerful and flexible semi-supervised learning technique on graphs. Neural network architectures, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training objective for neural networks, Neural Graph Machines, for combining the power of neural networks and label propagation. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs. The proposed method is experimentally validated on a wide range of tasks (multi- label classification on social graphs, news categorization and semantic intent classification) using different architectures (NNs, CNNs, and LSTM RNNs)."
Dynamic Neural Turing Machine with Continuous and Discrete Addressing Schemes,"In this paper, we extend neural Turing machine (NTM) into a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing a trainable memory addressing scheme. This addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones. We implement the D-NTM with both continuous, differentiable and discrete, non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects for learning to read and  write to a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU-controller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines. We also provide further experimental results on sequential MNIST, associative recall and copy tasks."
Is a picture worth a thousand words? A Deep Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture for Product Classification in e-commerce,"Classifying products into categories precisely and efficiently is a major challenge in modern e-commerce. The high traffic of new products uploaded daily and the dynamic nature of the categories raise the need for machine learning models that can reduce the cost and time of human editors. In this paper, we propose a decision level fusion approach for multi-modal product classification using text and image inputs. We train input specific state-of-the-art deep neural networks for each input source, show the potential of forging them together into a multi-modal architecture and train a novel policy network that learns to choose between them. Finally, we demonstrate that our multi-modal network improves the top-1 accuracy $\%$ over both networks on a real-world large-scale product classification dataset that we collected from Walmart.com. While we focus on image-text fusion that characterizes e-commerce domains, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio, video, physical sensors, etc."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Steganography,"Steganography is collection of methods to hide secret information (""payload"") within non-secret information (""container""). Its counterpart, Steganalysis, is the practice of determining if a message contains a hidden payload, and recovering it if possible. Presence of hidden payloads is typically detected by a binary classifier. In the present study, we propose a new model for generating image-like containers based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). This approach allows to generate more setganalysis-secure message embedding using standard steganography algorithms. Experiment results demonstrate that the new model successfully deceives the steganography analyzer, and for this reason, can be used in  steganographic applications."
MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset,"This paper presents our recent work on the design and development of a new, large scale dataset, which we name MS MARCO, for MAchine Reading COmprehension. This new dataset is aimed to overcome a number of well-known weaknesses of previous publicly available datasets for the same task of reading comprehension and question answering. In MS MARCO, all questions are sampled from real anonymized user queries. The context passages, from which answers in the dataset are derived, are extracted from real web documents using the most advanced version of the Bing search engine. The answers to the queries are human generated. Finally, a subset of these queries has multiple answers. We aim to release one million queries and the corresponding answers in the dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most comprehensive real-world dataset of its kind in both quantity and quality. We are currently releasing 100,000 queries with their corresponding answers to inspire work in reading comprehension and question answering along with gathering feedback from the research community."
OMG: Orthogonal Method of Grouping With Application of K-Shot Learning,"Training a classifier with only a few examples remains a significant barrier when using neural networks with large number of parameters. Though various specialized network architectures have been proposed for these k-shot learning tasks to avoid overfitting, a question remains: is there a generalizable framework for the k-shot learning problem that can leverage existing deep models as well as avoid model overfitting? In this paper, we proposed a generalizable k-shot learning framework that can be used on any pre-trained network, by grouping network parameters to produce a low-dimensional representation of the parameter space. The grouping of the parameters is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the parameter space. To avoid overfitting, groups of parameters will be updated together during the k-shot training process. Furthermore, this framework can be integrated with any existing popular deep neural networks such as VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, without any changes in the original network structure or any sacrifices in performance. We evaluate our framework on a wide range of intra/inter-dataset k-shot learning tasks and show state-of-the-art performance."
Unrolled Generative Adversarial Networks,"We introduce a method to stabilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by defining the generator objective with respect to an unrolled optimization of the discriminator. This allows training to be adjusted between using the optimal discriminator in the generator's objective, which is ideal but infeasible in practice, and using the current value of the discriminator, which is often unstable and leads to poor solutions. We show how this technique solves the common problem of mode collapse, stabilizes training of GANs with complex recurrent generators, and increases diversity and coverage of the data distribution by the generator."
TopicRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency,"In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence – both semantic and syntactic – but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis and report a new state-of-the-art error rate on the IMDB movie review dataset that amounts to a 13.3% improvement over the previous best result. Finally TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation."
Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling,"Current language modeling architectures often use recurrent neural networks. Recently, various methods for incorporating differentiable memory into these architectures have been proposed. When predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history and thus can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention models produce a single output vector per time step that is used for predicting the next token as well as the key and value of a differentiable memory of the history of tokens. In this paper, we propose a key-value attention mechanism that produces separate representations for the key and value of a memory, and for a representation that encodes the next-word distribution. This usage of past memories outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that it mainly utilizes past memory only of the previous five representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model which simply uses a concatenation of output representations from the previous three-time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models."
Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model,"Segmentation and labeling of high dimensional time series data has wide applications in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the label information for high dimensional data, realizing this objective in an unsupervised way is highly desirable. Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is a classical tool for this problem. However, existing HSMM and its variants has simple conditional assumptions of observations, thus the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex dynamics within segments is limited. To tackle this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the generative process in HSMM, resulting the Recurrent HSMM (R-HSMM). To accelerate the inference while preserving accuracy, we designed a structure encoding function to mimic the exact inference. By generalizing the penalty method to distribution space, we are able to train the model and the encoding function simultaneously. Empirical results show that the proposed R-HSMM achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both synthetic and real-world datasets. "
GRAM: Graph-based Attention Model for Healthcare Representation Learning,"Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling in healthcare, but two important challenges remain:
- Data insufficiency: Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. 
- Interpretation: The representations learned by deep learning models should align with medical knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. 
Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. 
We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task.
Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts."
Efficient Softmax Approximation for GPUs,"We propose an approximate strategy to efficiently train neural network based language models over very large vocabularies. Our approach, called adaptive softmax, circumvents the linear dependency on the vocabulary size by exploiting the unbalanced word distribution to form clusters that explicitly minimize the expectation of computational complexity. Our approach further reduces the computational cost by exploiting the specificities of modern architectures and matrix-matrix vector operations, making it particularly suited for graphical processing units. Our experiments carried out on standard benchmarks, such as EuroParl and One Billion Word, show that our approach brings a large gain in efficiency over standard approximations while achieving an accuracy close to that of the full softmax."
Dataset Augmentation in Feature Space,"Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.

Deep Variational Bayes Filters: Unsupervised Learning of State Space Models from Raw Data,"We introduce Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a new method for unsupervised learning of latent Markovian state space models. Leveraging recent advances in Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes, DVBF can overcome intractable inference distributions by means of variational inference. Thus, it can handle highly nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial dependencies such as image sequences without domain knowledge. Our experiments show that enabling backpropagation through transitions enforces state space assumptions and significantly improves information content of the latent embedding. This also enables realistic long-term prediction."
Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions,"We propose regularizing neural networks by penalizing low entropy output distributions. We show that penalizing low entropy output distributions, which has been shown to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, acts as a strong regularizer in supervised learning. We connect our confidence penalty to label smoothing through the direction of the KL divergence between networks output distribution and the uniform distribution. We exhaustively evaluate our proposed confidence penalty and label smoothing (uniform and unigram) on 6 common benchmarks: image classification (MNIST and Cifar-10), language modeling (Penn Treebank), machine translation (WMT'14 English-to-German), and speech recognition (TIMIT and WSJ). We find that both label smoothing and our confidence penalty improve state-of-the-art models across benchmarks without modifying existing hyper-parameters.

Options Discovery with Budgeted Reinforcement Learning,"We consider the problem of learning hierarchical policies for Reinforcement Learning able to discover options, an option corresponding to a sub-policy over a set of primitive actions. Different models have been proposed during the last decade that usually rely on a predefined set of options. We specifically address the problem of automatically discovering options in decision processes. We describe a new RL learning framework called Bi-POMDP, and a new learning model called Budgeted Option Neural Network (BONN) able to discover options based on a budgeted learning objective. Since Bi-POMDP are more general than POMDP, our model can also be used to discover options for classical RL tasks. The BONN model is evaluated on different classical RL problems, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative interesting results."
Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game.  In this paper, we propose the \emph{Generative Multi-Adversarial Network} (GMAN), a framework that extends GANs to multiple discriminators. In previous work, the successful training of GANs requires modifying the minimax objective to accelerate training early on. In contrast, GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered objective. We explore a number of design perspectives with the discriminator role ranging from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher.  Image generation tasks comparing the proposed framework to standard GANs demonstrate GMAN produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations when measured by a pairwise GAM-type metric."
Mollifying Networks,"The optimization of deep neural networks can be more challenging than traditional convex optimization problems due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss function, e.g. it can involve pathological landscapes such as saddle-surfaces that can be difficult to escape from for algorithms based on simple gradient descent. In this paper, we attack the problem of optimization of highly non-convex neural networks by starting with a smoothed -- or \textit{mollified} -- objective function which becomes more complex as the training proceeds.  Our proposition is inspired by the recent studies in continuation methods: similarly to curriculum methods, we begin by learning an easier (possibly convex) objective function and let it evolve during training until it eventually becomes the original, difficult to optimize objective function. The complexity of the mollified networks is controlled by a single hyperparameter that is annealed during training. We show improvements on various difficult optimization tasks and establish a relationship between recent works on continuation methods for neural networks and mollifiers.

beta-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework,"Learning an interpretable factorised representation of the independent data generative factors of the world without supervision is an important precursor for the development of artificial intelligence that is able to learn and reason in the same way that humans do. We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta > 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data."
Online Structure Learning for Sum-Product Networks,"Sum-product networks have recently emerged as an attractive representation due to their dual view as a special type of deep neural network with clear semantics and a special type of probabilistic graphical model for which inference is always tractable. Those properties follow from some conditions (i.e., completeness and decomposability) that must be respected by the structure of the network.  As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice.  While several offline structure learning techniques exist, this paper describes the first online structure learning technique for continuous SPNs with Gaussian leaves."
Offline Bilingual Word Vectors Without a Dictionary,"Usually bilingual word vectors are trained ""online''; whereby both languages are embedded simultaneously in a single space. Mikolov showed that they can also be found ""offline""; whereby two pre-trained embeddings are aligned by a linear transformation, using dictionaries compiled from expert knowledge. In this work, we prove that the linear transformation between the two spaces should be orthogonal, and can be found using canonical correlation analysis. We introduce an ""inverted softmax"" for identifying translation pairs, with which we improve the precision @1 of Mikolov's original mapping from 34% to 43%, when translating a test set composed of both common and rare English words into Italian. Furthermore, we can learn the transformation without expert bilingual signal by constructing a pseudo-dictionary, using either cognate words or a corpus of aligned sentences. Finally, we extend our method to identify the true translations of English sentences from a corpus of 200k Italian sentences with a precision @1 of 68%."
Unsupervised Learning of State Representations for Multiple Tasks,"We present an approach for learning state representations in multi-task reinforcement learning. Our method learns multiple low-dimensional state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised fashion, without any knowledge of which task is executed, nor of the number of tasks involved.
The method is based on a gated neural network architecture, trained with an extension of the learning with robotic priors objective. In two simulated experiments, we show that our method is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning, and we analyze why and when it manages to do so."
DRAGNN: A Transition-Based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks,"In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing new recurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer activations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections to be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By connecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used architectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and recursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an {\em encoder} for downstream tasks and as a {\em decoder} for its own task simultaneously, resulting in more accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent Acyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN. We show that DRAGNN is significantly more accurate and efficient than seq2seq with attention for syntactic dependency parsing and yields more accurate multi-task learning for extractive summarization tasks.

Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference Analysis,"This article presents the prediction difference analysis method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input. When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans)."
Joint Multimodal Learning with Deep Generative Models,"We investigate deep generative models that can exchange multiple modalities bi-directionally, e.g., generating images from corresponding texts and vice versa. Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from multiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bi-directionally.

Hierarchical Memory Networks,"Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various state-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on SimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.

Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Several recent works have empirically observed that Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) are (approximately) invertible. To understand this approximate invertibility phenomenon and how to leverage it more effectively, we focus on a theoretical explanation and develop a mathematical model of sparse signal recovery that is consistent with CNNs with random weights. We give an exact connection to a particular model of model-based compressive sensing (and its recovery algorithms) and random-weight CNNs. We show empirically that several learned networks are consistent with our mathematical analysis and then demonstrate that with such a simple theoretical framework, we can obtain reasonable reconstruction results on real images. We also discuss gaps between our model assumptions and the CNN trained for classification in practical scenarios."
Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax,"Categorical variables are a natural choice for representing discrete structure in the world. However, stochastic neural networks rarely use categorical latent variables due to the inability to backpropagate through samples. In this work, we present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the non-differentiable sample from a categorical distribution with a differentiable sample from a novel Gumbel-Softmax distribution. This distribution has the essential property that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution. We show that our Gumbel-Softmax estimator outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks with categorical latent variables, and enables large speedups on semi-supervised classification."
Online Bayesian Transfer Learning for Sequential Data Modeling,"We consider the problem of inferring a sequence of hidden states associated with a sequence of observations produced by an individual within a population.  Instead of learning a single sequence model for the population (which does not account for variations within the population), we learn a set of basis sequence models based on different individuals.  The sequence of hidden states for a new individual is inferred in an online fashion by estimating a distribution over the basis models that best explain the sequence of observations of this new individual.  We explain how to do this in the context of hidden Markov models with Gaussian mixture models that are learned based on streaming data by online Bayesian moment matching.  The resulting transfer learning technique is demonstrated with three real-word applications: activity recognition based on smartphone sensors, sleep classification based on electroencephalography data and the prediction of the direction of future packet flows between a pair of servers in telecommunication networks. "
Latent Sequence Decompositions,"Sequence-to-sequence models rely on a fixed decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens that may be words, word-pieces or characters. The choice of these tokens and the decomposition of the target sequences into a sequence of tokens is often static, and independent of the input, output data domains. This can potentially lead to a sub-optimal choice of token dictionaries, as the decomposition is not informed by the particular problem being solved. In this paper we present Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD), a framework in which the decomposition of sequences into constituent tokens is learnt during the training of the model. The decomposition depends both on the input sequence and on the output sequence. In LSD, during training, the model samples decompositions incrementally, from left to right by locally sampling between valid extensions. We experiment with the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task. Our LSD model achieves 12.9% WER compared to a character baseline of 14.8% WER. When combined with a convolutional network on the encoder, we achieve a WER of 9.2%.
"
Incremental Sequence Learning,"    Deep learning research over the past years has shown that by increasing the scope or difficulty of the learning problem over time, increasingly complex learning problems can be addressed. We study incremental learning in the context of sequence learning, using generative RNNs in the form of multi-layer recurrent Mixture Density Networks.

    We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to sequence learning.
    
    Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the first few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance criterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for training is increased.

    To evaluate Incremental Sequence Learning and comparison methods, we introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set: predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, where the familiar handwritten digit images have been transformed to pen stroke sequences representing the skeletons of the digits.

    We find that Incremental Sequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test performance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the test error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower variance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison method have stopped improving. A trained sequence prediction model is also used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it is found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance compared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.

Paleo: A Performance Model for Deep Neural Networks,"Although various scalable deep learning software packages have been proposed, it remains unclear how to best leverage parallel and distributed computing infrastructure to accelerate their training and deployment. Moreover, the effectiveness of existing parallel and distributed systems varies widely based on the neural network architecture and dataset under consideration.  In order to efficiently explore the space of scalable deep learning systems and quickly diagnose their effectiveness for a given problem instance, we introduce an analytical performance model called Paleo. Our key observation is that a neural network architecture carries with it a declarative specification of the computational requirements associated with its training and evaluation. By extracting these requirements from a given architecture and mapping them to a specific point within the design space of software, hardware and communication strategies, Paleo can efficiently and accurately model the expected scalability and performance of a putative deep learning system.  We show that Paleo is robust to the choice of network architecture, hardware, software, communication schemes, and parallelization strategies. We further demonstrate its ability to accurately model various recently published scalability results for CNNs such as NiN, Inception and AlexNet."
Neural Taylor Approximations: Convergence and Exploration in Rectifier Networks,"Modern convolutional networks, incorporating rectifiers and max-pooling, are neither smooth nor convex. Standard guarantees therefore do not apply. Nevertheless, methods from convex optimization such as gradient descent and Adam are widely used as building blocks for deep learning algorithms. This paper provides the first convergence guarantee applicable to modern convnets. The guarantee matches a lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The key technical tool is the neural Taylor approximation -- a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks -- and the associated Taylor loss. Experiments on a range of optimizers, layers, and tasks provide evidence that the analysis accurately captures the dynamics of neural optimization.

The second half of the paper applies the Taylor approximation to isolate the main difficulty in training rectifier nets: that gradients are shattered. We investigate the hypothesis that, by exploring the space of activation configurations more thoroughly, adaptive optimizers such as RMSProp and Adam are able to converge to better solutions."
Boosting Image Captioning with Attributes,"Automatically describing an image with a natural language has been an emerging challenge in both fields of computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory with Attributes (LSTM-A) - a novel architecture that integrates attributes into the successful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) plus Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) image captioning framework, by training them in an end-to-end manner. To incorporate attributes, we construct variants of architectures by feeding image representations and attributes into RNNs in different ways to explore the mutual but also fuzzy relationship between them. Extensive experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset and our framework achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep models. Most remarkably, we obtain METEOR/CIDEr-D of 25.2%/98.6% on testing data of widely used and publicly available splits in \citep{Karpathy:CVPR15} when extracting image representations by GoogleNet and achieve to date top-1 performance on COCO captioning Leaderboard."
PGQ: Combining policy gradient and Q-learning,"Policy gradient is an efficient technique for improving a policy in a reinforcement learning setting. However, vanilla online variants are on-policy only and not able to take advantage of off-policy data. In this paper we describe a new technique that combines policy gradient with off-policy Q-learning, drawing experience from a replay buffer. This is motivated by making a connection between the fixed points of the regularized policy gradient algorithm and the Q-values. This connection allows us to estimate the Q-values from the action preferences of the policy, to which we apply Q-learning updates. We refer to the new technique as ‘PGQ’, for policy gradient and Q-learning. We also establish an equivalency between action-value fitting techniques and actor-critic algorithms, showing that regularized policy gradient techniques can be interpreted as advantage function learning algorithms. We conclude with some numerical examples that demonstrate improved data efficiency and stability of PGQ. In particular, we tested PGQ on the full suite of Atari games and achieved performance exceeding that of both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning.

Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language,"The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text. This passive learning is problematic if we are in- terested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communi- cation. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message to the receiver, while the receiver must rely on it to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore whether the “word meanings” induced in the game reflect intuitive semantic properties of the objects depicted in the image, and we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents’ code into natural language, a necessary step in developing machines that should eventually be able to communicate with humans.

Density estimation using Real NVP,"Unsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task. We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful invertible and learnable transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact log-likelihood computation, exact sampling, exact inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood evaluation and latent variable manipulations."
Skip-graph: Learning graph embeddings with an encoder-decoder model,"In this work, we study the problem of feature representation learning for graph-structured data. Many of the existing work in the area are task-specific and based on supervised techniques. We study a method for obtaining a generic feature representation for a graph using an unsupervised approach. The neural encoder-decoder model is a method that has been used in the natural language processing domain to learn feature representations of sentences. In our proposed approach, we train the encoder-decoder model to predict the random walk sequence of neighboring regions in a graph given a random walk along a particular region. The goal is to map subgraphs — as represented by their random walks — that are structurally and functionally similar to nearby locations in feature space. We evaluate the learned graph vectors using several real-world datasets on the graph classification task. The proposed model is able to achieve good results against state-of- the-art techniques."
Finding a Jack-of-All-Trades: An Examination of Semi-supervised Learning in Reading Comprehension,"Deep learning has proven useful on many NLP tasks including reading
comprehension. However it requires a lot of training data which are not
available in some domains of application. Hence we examine the possibility
of using data-rich domains to pre-train models and then apply them in
domains where training data are harder to get. Specifically, we train a
neural-network-based model on two context-question-answer datasets, the
BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, and we monitor transfer to subsets of bAbI,
a set of artificial tasks designed to test specific reasoning abilities, and of
SQuAD, a question-answering dataset which is much closer to real-world
applications. Our experiments show very limited transfer if the model isn’t
shown any training examples from the target domain however the results
are promising if the model is shown at least a few target-domain examples.
Furthermore we show that the effect of pre-training is not limited to word
embeddings."
Recurrent Batch Normalization,"We propose a reparameterization of LSTM that brings the benefits of batch normalization to recurrent neural networks. Whereas previous works only apply batch normalization to the input-to-hidden transformation of RNNs, we demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to batch-normalize the hidden-to-hidden transition, thereby reducing internal covariate shift between time steps.

We evaluate our proposal on various sequential problems such as sequence classification, language modeling and question answering. Our empirical results show that our batch-normalized LSTM consistently leads to faster convergence and improved generalization."
SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts,"Restart techniques are common in gradient-free optimization to deal with multimodal functions. Partial warm restarts are also gaining popularity in gradient-based optimization to improve the rate of convergence in accelerated gradient schemes to deal with ill-conditioned functions. In this paper, we propose a simple warm restart technique for stochastic gradient descent to improve its anytime performance when training deep neural networks. We empirically study its performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets,  where we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results at 3.14\% and 16.21\%, respectively. Our source code is available at \url{https://github.com/loshchil/SGDR}"
DyVEDeep: Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have advanced the state-of-the-art on a variety of machine learning tasks and are deployed widely in many real-world products. However, the compute and data requirements demanded by large-scale DNNs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address this challenge in the context of DNN inference. We propose Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks (DyVEDeep), which exploit the heterogeneity in the characteristics of inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency while maintaining the same classification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort knobs, which in course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of computations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its compute effort only on the critical computations, while the skipping/approximating the rest. We propose 3 effort knobs that operate at different levels of granularity viz. neuron, feature and layer levels. We build DyVEDeep versions for 5 popular image recognition benchmarks on 3 image datasets---MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet. Across all benchmarks, DyVEDeep achieves 6X-8X reduction in number of scalar operations, which translates to 3X-5X performance improvement over a Caffe-based sequential software implementation, for negligible loss in accuracy."
Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation By Learning Morphology,"Neural machine translation aims at building a single large neural network that can be trained to maximize translation performance. The encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism achieves a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based systems. However, the use of large vocabulary becomes the bottleneck in both training and improving the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder which translates at character level. This gives rise to a deep character-level model consisting of seven recurrent networks. Such a deep model has two major advantages. It avoids the large vocabulary issue radically; at the same time, it is more efficient in training than word-based models. Our model obtains a higher BLEU score than the bpe-based model after training for one epoch on En-Fr and Cs-En translation tasks. Further analyses show that our model is able to learn morphology.

Learning a Natural Language Interface with Neural Programmer,"Learning a natural language interface for database tables is a challenging task that involves deep language understanding and multi-step reasoning. The task is often approached by mapping natural language queries to logical forms or programs that provide the desired response when executed on the database. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model to induce such programs on a real-world dataset. We enhance the objective function of Neural Programmer, a neural network with built-in discrete operations, and apply it on WikiTableQuestions, a natural language question-answering dataset. The model is trained end-to-end with weak supervision of question-answer pairs, and does not require domain-specific grammars, rules, or annotations that are key elements in previous approaches to program induction. The main experimental result in this paper is that a single Neural Programmer model achieves 34.2% accuracy using only 10,000 examples with weak supervision. An ensemble of 15 models, with a trivial combination technique, achieves 37.2% accuracy, which is competitive to the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 37.1% obtained by a traditional natural language semantic parser."
Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization,"Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can
exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance.
Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties
of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.

Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional
approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in
practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art
convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic
gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This
phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs
even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We
corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction
showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite
sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the
number of data points as it usually does in practice.

We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models."
Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to Nonlinear Invariants,"In this paper we propose a scalable version of a state-of-the-art deterministic time-
invariant feature extraction approach based on consecutive changes of basis and
nonlinearities, namely, the scattering network. The first focus of the paper is to
extend the scattering network to allow the use of higher order nonlinearities as
well as extracting nonlinear and Fourier based statistics leading to the required in-
variants of any inherently structured input. In order to reach fast convolutions and
to leverage the intrinsic structure of wavelets, we derive our complete model in the
Fourier domain. In addition of providing fast computations, we are now able to
exploit sparse matrices due to extremely high sparsity well localized in the Fourier
domain. As a result, we are able to reach a true linear time complexity with in-
puts in the Fourier domain allowing fast and energy efficient solutions to machine
learning tasks. Validation of the features and computational results will be pre-
sented through the use of these invariant coefficients to perform classification on
audio recordings of bird songs captured in multiple different soundscapes. In the
end, the applicability of the presented solutions to deep artificial neural networks
is discussed."
Annealing Gaussian into ReLU: a New Sampling Strategy for Leaky-ReLU RBM,"Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite graphical model that is used as the building block in energy-based deep generative models. Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).  We further demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any additional computational cost."
Boosted Residual Networks,"In this paper we present a new ensemble method, called Boosted Residual Networks,
which builds an ensemble of Residual Networks by growing the member
network at each round of boosting. The proposed approach combines recent developements
in Residual Networks - a method for creating very deep networks by
including a shortcut layer between different groups of layers - with the Deep Incremental
Boosting, which has been proposed as a methodology to train fast ensembles
of networks of increasing depth through the use of boosting. We demonstrate
that the synergy of Residual Networks and Deep Incremental Boosting has better
potential than simply boosting a Residual Network of fixed structure or using the
equivalent Deep Incremental Boosting without the shortcut layers."
Reinforcement Learning through Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic on a GPU,"We introduce a hybrid CPU/GPU version of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, currently the state-of-the-art method in reinforcement learning for various gaming tasks. We analyze its computational traits and concentrate on the critical aspects to leverage the GPU's computational power. We introduce a system of queues and a dynamic scheduling strategy, potentially helpful for other asynchronous algorithms as well. Our hybrid CPU/GPU version of A3C, based on TensorFlow, achieves a significant speed up compared to a CPU implementation and we will make it publicly available to other researchers."
Learning to Navigate in Complex Environments,"Learning to navigate in complex environments with dynamic elements is an important milestone in developing AI agents. In this work we formulate the navigation question as a reinforcement learning problem and show that data efficiency and task performance can be dramatically improved by relying on additional auxiliary tasks to bootstrap learning. In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. Using this approach we can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently. We provide detailed analysis of the agent behaviour, its ability to localise, and its network activity dynamics, that show that the agent implicitly learns key navigation abilities, with only sparse rewards and without direct supervision."
Multi-task learning with deep model based reinforcement learning,"In recent years, model-free methods that use deep learning have achieved great success in many different reinforcement learning environments. Most successful approaches focus on solving a single task, while multi-task reinforcement learning remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a model based approach to deep reinforcement learning which we use to solve different tasks simultaneously. We show that our approach not only does not degrade but actually benefits from learning multiple tasks. For our model, we also present a new kind of recurrent neural network inspired by residual networks that decouples memory from computation allowing to model complex environments that do not require lots of memory. The code will be released before ICLR 2017."
DeepCoder: Learning to Write Programs,"We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style problems from input-output examples using deep learning. The approach is to train a neural network to predict properties of the  program that generated the outputs from the inputs. We use the neural network's predictions to augment search techniques from the programming languages community, including enumerative search and an SMT-based solver. Empirically, we show that our approach leads to an order of magnitude speedup over the strong non-augmented baselines and a Recurrent Neural Network approach, and that we are able to solve problems of difficulty comparable to the simplest problems on programming competition websites."
Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,"Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.84, which is only 0.1 percent worse and 1.2x faster than the current state-of-the-art model. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art."
Opening the vocabulary of  neural language models with character-level word representations,"This paper introduces an architecture for an open-vocabulary neural language model. Word representations are computed on-the-fly by a convolution network followed by pooling layer. This allows the model to consider any word, in the context or for the prediction. The training objective is derived from the Noise-Contrastive Estimation to circumvent the lack of vocabulary. We test the ability of our model to build representations of unknown words on the MT task of IWSLT-2016 from English to Czech, in a reranking setting. Experimental results show promising results, with a gain up to 0.7 BLEU point. They also emphasize the difficulty and instability when training such models with character-based representations for the predicted words."
Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks,"We present an algorithm for policy search in stochastic dynamical systems using
model-based reinforcement learning. The system dynamics are described with
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that include stochastic input variables.  These
input variables allow us to capture complex statistical
patterns in the transition dynamics (e.g. multi-modality and
heteroskedasticity), which are usually missed by alternative modeling approaches. After
learning the dynamics, our BNNs are then fed into an algorithm that performs
random roll-outs and uses stochastic optimization for policy learning. We train
our BNNs by minimizing $\alpha$-divergences with $\alpha = 0.5$, which usually produces better
results than other techniques such as variational Bayes. We illustrate the performance of our method by
solving a challenging problem where model-based approaches usually fail and by
obtaining promising results in real-world scenarios including the control of a
gas turbine and an industrial benchmark."
HFH: Homologically Functional Hashing for Compressing Deep Neural Networks,"As the complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) trends to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data, memory and energy consumption has been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications, especially on mobile devices. This paper presents a novel structure based on homologically functional hashing to compress DNNs, shortly named as HFH. For each  weight entry in a deep net, HFH uses multiple low-cost hash functions to fetch values in a compression space, and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The compression space is homological because all layers fetch hashed values from it. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. On several benchmark datasets, HFH demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy. Particularly, HFH includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated scenario and shows significantly improved performance. Moreover, the homological hashing essence facilitates us to efficiently figure out one single desired compression ratio, instead of exhaustive searching throughout a combinatory space configured by all layers."
Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data. Much of this progress has been achieved through devising recurrent units and architectures with the flexibility to capture complex statistics in the data, such as long range dependency or dependency on specific parts of the sequence (attention mechanisms). However, while many sequential data (such as video, speech or language) can have highly variable information flow, most recurrent models still consume input features at a constant rate and perform a constant number of computations per time step, which can be detrimental to both speed and model capacity. In this paper, we explore a modification to existing recurrent units which allows them to learn to vary the amount of computation they perform at each step as required, without prior knowledge of the sequence's time structure. We show experimentally that not only is our model more computationally efficient, it also leads to better performance overall on our evaluation tasks."
The Incredible Shrinking Neural Network: New Perspectives on Learning Representations Through The Lens of Pruning,"How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks? A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training. "
Multiplicative LSTM for sequence modelling,"We introduce multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM), a novel recurrent neural network architecture for sequence modelling that combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) and multiplicative recurrent neural network architectures. mLSTM is characterised by its ability to have different recurrent transition functions for each possible input, which we argue makes it more expressive for autoregressive density estimation. We demonstrate empirically that mLSTM outperforms standard LSTM and its deep variants for a range of character level modelling tasks, and that this improvement increases with the complexity of the task. This model achieves a test error of 1.19 bits/character on the last 4 million characters of the Hutter prize dataset when combined with dynamic evaluation."
Efficient iterative policy optimization,"We tackle the issue of finding a good policy when the number of policy updates is limited. This is done by approximating the expected policy reward as a sequence of concave lower bounds which can be efficiently maximized, drastically reducing the number of policy updates required to achieve good performance. We also extend existing methods to negative rewards, enabling the use of control variates."
Tensorial Mixture Models,"We introduce a generative model, we call Tensorial Mixture Models (TMMs) based on mixtures of basic
component distributions over local structures (e.g. patches in an image) where the dependencies between
the local-structures are represented by a ""priors tensor"" holding the prior probabilities of assigning a
component distribution to each local-structure.

In their general form, TMMs are intractable as the priors tensor is typically of exponential size. However,
when the priors tensor is decomposed it gives rise to an arithmetic circuit which in turn transforms the
TMM into a Convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). A ConvAC corresponds to a shallow (single hidden layer)
network when the priors tensor is decomposed by a CP (sum of rank-1) approach and corresponds to a
deep network when the decomposition follows the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) model.

The ConvAC representation of a TMM possesses several attractive properties. First, the inference is tractable
and is implemented by a forward pass through a deep network. Second, the architectural design of the model
follows the deep networks community design, i.e.,  the structure of TMMs is determined by just two easily
understood factors: size of pooling windows and number of channels. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model when tackling the problem of classification with missing data, leveraging TMMs unique ability of
tractable marginalization which leads to optimal classifiers regardless of the missingness distribution."
Deep Variational Information Bottleneck,"We present a variational approximation to the information bottleneck of Tishby et al. (1999). This variational approach allows us to parameterize the informa- tion bottleneck model using a neural network and leverage the reparameterization trick for efficient training. We call this method “Deep Variational Information Bottleneck”, or Deep VIB. We show that models trained with the VIB objective outperform those that are trained with other forms of regularization, in terms of generalization performance and robustness to adversarial attack."
The Neural Noisy Channel,"We formulate sequence to sequence transduction as a noisy channel decoding problem and use recurrent neural networks to parameterise the source and channel models. Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-away effects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explain their inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only paired training samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal output distribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioning sequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequent symbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder. Experimental results on abstractive sentence summarisation, morphological inflection, and machine translation show that noisy channel models outperform direct models, and that they significantly benefit from increased amounts of unpaired output data that direct models cannot easily use."
An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications,"Since the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a prominent technique in the field of computer vision, the ImageNet classification challenge has played a major role in advancing the state-of-the-art. While accuracy figures have steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has not been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint are an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs."
Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment,"Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy. While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer pro-gram is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carried out in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games.As a results, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)   (Bellemare et al., 2013)has  become  a  commonly  used  benchmark  environment  allowing  algorithms  to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans.  In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment — RLE, based on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch.  SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training method based on training two agents against each other."
Learning to Understand: Incorporating Local Contexts with Global Attention for Sentiment Classification,"Recurrent neural networks have shown their ability to construct sentence or paragraph representations. Variants such as LSTM overcome the problem of vanishing gradients to some degree, thus being able to model long-time dependency. Still, these recurrent based models lack the ability of capturing complex semantic compositions. To address this problem, we propose a model which can incorporate local contexts with the guide of global context attention. Both the local and global contexts are obtained through LSTM networks. The working procedure of this model is just like how we human beings read a text and then answer a related question. Empirical studies show that the proposed model can achieve state of the art on some benchmark datasets. Attention visualization also verifies our intuition. Meanwhile, this model does not need pretrained embeddings to get good results."
Automatic Rule Extraction from Long Short Term Memory Networks,"Although deep learning models have proved effective at solving problems in natural language processing, the mechanism by which they come to their conclusions is often unclear.   As a result, these models are generally treated as black boxes, yielding no insight of the underlying learned patterns.  In this paper we consider Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and, using the recently introduced WikiMovies dataset, we demonstrate a new approach for tracking the importance of a given input to the LSTM for a given output.   We then use frequent patterns of important words to automatically construct a simple, rule-based classifier which mimics the output of the fitted LSTM."
Neural Functional Programming,"We discuss a range of modeling choices that arise when constructing an end-to-end differentiable programming language suitable for learning programs from input-output examples. Taking cues from programming languages research, we study the effect of memory allocation schemes, immutable data, type systems, and built-in control-flow structures on the success rate of learning algorithms. We build a range of models leading up to a simple differentiable functional programming language. Our empirical evaluation shows that this language allows to learn far more programs than existing baselines."
Fast Adaptation in Generative Models with Generative Matching Networks,"Despite recent advances, the remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models are necessity of extensive training and difficulties with generalization from small number of training examples.
Both problems may be addressed by conditional generative models that are trained to adapt the generative distribution to additional input data.
So far this idea was explored only under certain limitations such as restricting the input data to be a single object or multiple objects representing the same concept.  
In this work we develop a new class of deep generative model called generative matching networks which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks and the ideas from meta-learning.
By conditioning on the additional input dataset, generative matching networks may instantly learn new concepts that were not available during the training but conform to a similar generative process, without explicit limitations on the number of additional input objects or the number of concepts they represent. 
Our experiments on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that generative matching networks can significantly improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available to the model and also adapt the latent space which is beneficial in the context of feature extraction."
LipNet: Sentence-level Lipreading,"Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, an LSTM recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first lipreading model to operate at sentence-level using a single end-to-end speaker-independent deep model to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model. On the GRID corpus, LipNet achieves 93.4% accuracy, outperforming experienced human lipreaders and the previous 79.6% state-of-the-art accuracy."
Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning,"Sequence models can be trained using supervised learning and a next-step prediction objective. This approach, however, suffers from known failure modes. For example, it is notoriously difficult to ensure multi-step generated sequences have coherent global structure. Motivated by the fact that reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to impose arbitrary properties on generated data by choosing appropriate reward functions, in this paper we propose a novel approach for sequence training which combines Maximum Likelihood (ML) and RL training. We refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from stochastic optimal control (SOC). We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note-RNN is then refined using RL, where the reward function is a combination of rewards based on rules of music theory, as well as the output of another trained Note-RNN. We show that by combining ML and RL, this RL Tuner method can not only produce more pleasing melodies, but that it can significantly reduce unwanted behaviors and failure modes of the RNN."
A Simple yet Effective Method to Prune Dense Layers of Neural Networks,"Neural networks are usually over-parameterized with significant redundancy in the number of required neurons which results in unnecessary computation and memory usage at inference time. One common approach to address this issue is to prune these big networks by removing extra neurons and parameters while maintaining the accuracy. In this paper, we propose NoiseOut, a fully automated pruning algorithm based on the correlation between activations of neurons in the hidden layers. We prove that adding additional output neurons with entirely random targets results into a higher correlation between neurons which makes pruning by NoiseOut even more efficient. Finally, we test our method on various networks
and datasets. These experiments exhibit high pruning rates while maintaining the accuracy of the original network."
Emergent Logical Structure in Vector Representations of Neural Readers,"Reading comprehension is a question answering task where the answer is to be found in a given passage about entities and events not mentioned in general knowledge sources. A significant number of neural architectures for this task (neural readers) have recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets. We present experiments supporting the existence of logical structure in the hidden state vectors of “aggregation readers” such as the Attentive Reader and Stanford Reader. The logical structure of aggregation readers reflects the architecture of “explicit reference readers” such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the Gated Attention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader. This relationship between aggregation readers and explicit reference readers presents a case study in emergent logical structure. In an independent contribution, we show that the addition of linguistics features to the input to existing neural readers significantly boosts performance yielding the best results to date on the Who-did-What datasets."
Riemannian Optimization for Skip-Gram Negative Sampling,"Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model, well known by its implementation in ""word2vec"" software, is usually optimized by stochastic gradient descent. It can be shown that optimizing for SGNS objective can be viewed as an optimization problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix."
RL^2: Fast Reinforcement Learning via Slow Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a “fast” reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL^2, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (“slow”) RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the “fast” RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL^2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL^2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL^2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems."
Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop,"An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.  Most research has focused on learning from fixed training sets of labeled data rather than interacting with a dialogue partner in an online fashion. In this paper we explore this direction in a reinforcement learning setting where the bot improves its question-answering ability from feedback a teacher gives following its generated responses. We build a simulator that tests various aspects of such learning in a synthetic environment, and introduce models that work in this regime.  Finally, real experiments with Mechanical Turk validate the approach.
"
Adversarially Learned Inference,"We introduce the adversarially learned inference (ALI) model, which jointly
learns a generation network and an inference network using an adversarial
process. The generation network maps samples from stochastic latent variables to
the data space while the inference network maps training examples in data space
to the space of latent variables. An adversarial game is cast between these two
networks and a discriminative network that is trained to distinguish between
joint latent/data-space samples from the generative network and joint samples
from the inference network.  We illustrate the ability of the model to learn
mutually coherent inference and generation networks through the inspections of
model samples and reconstructions and confirm the usefulness of the learned
representations by obtaining a performance competitive with other recent
approaches on the semi-supervised SVHN task."
Deep Error-Correcting Output Codes,"Existing deep networks are generally initialized with unsupervised methods, such as random assignments and greedy layerwise pre-training. This may result in the whole training process (initialization/pre-training + fine-tuning) to be very time consuming. In this paper, we combine the ideas of ensemble learning and deep learning, and present a novel deep learning framework called deep error-correcting output codes (DeepECOC). DeepECOC are composed of multiple layers of the ECOC module, which combines multiple binary classifiers for feature learning. Here, the weights learned for the binary classifiers can be considered as weights between two successive layers, while the outputs of the combined binary classifiers as the outputs of a hidden layer. On the one hand, the ECOC modules can be learned using given supervisory information, and on the other hand, based on the ternary coding design, the weights can be learned only using part of the training data. Hence, the supervised pre-training of DeepECOC is in general very effective and efficient. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare DeepECOC with traditional ECOC, feature learning and deep learning algorithms on several benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that DeepECOC perform not only better than traditional ECOC and feature learning algorithms, but also state-of the-art deep learning models in most cases. "
Learning through Dialogue Interactions,"A good dialogue agent should have the ability to interact with users. In this work, we explore this direction by designing a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie  domain that allow the learner to interact with a teacher by both asking and answering questions. We investigate how a learner can benefit from asking questions in both an offline and online reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions. Our work represents a first step in developing end-to-end learned interactive dialogue agents.

Marginal Deep Architectures: Deep learning for Small and Middle Scale Applications,"In recent years, many deep architectures have been proposed in different fields. However, to obtain good results, most of the previous deep models need a large number of training data. In this paper, for small and middle scale applications, we
propose a novel deep learning framework based on stacked feature learning models. Particularly, we stack marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) layer by layer for the initialization of the deep architecture and call it “Marginal Deep Architectures” (MDA). In the implementation of MDA, the weight matrices of MFA are first learned layer by layer, and then we exploit some deep learning techniques, such as back propagation, dropout and denoising to fine tune the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, we have compared it with some feature learning methods and deep learning models on 7 small and middle scale real-world applications, including handwritten digits recognition, speech recognition, historical document understanding, image classification, action recognition and so on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDA performs not only better than shallow feature learning models, but also state-of-the-art deep learning models in these applications."
Discovering objects and their relations from entangled scene representations,"Our world can be succinctly and compactly described as structured scenes of objects and relations. A typical room, for example, contains salient objects such as tables, chairs and books, and these objects typically relate to each other by virtue of their correlated features, such as position, function and shape. Humans exploit knowledge of objects and their relations for learning a wide spectrum of tasks, and more generally when learning the structure underlying observed data. In this work, we introduce relation networks (RNs) - a general purpose neural network architecture for object-relation reasoning. We show that RNs are capable of learning object relations from scene description data. Furthermore, we show that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations of scene images provided by a variational autoencoder. The model can also be used in conjunction with differentiable memory mechanisms for implicit relation discovery in one-shot learning tasks. Our results suggest that relation networks are a powerful architecture for solving a variety of problems that require object relation reasoning."
Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data,"In this paper we present a technique to train neural network models on small amounts of data. Current methods for training neural networks on small amounts of rich data typically rely on strategies such as fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network or the use of  domain-specific hand-engineered features. Here we take the  approach of treating network layers, or entire networks, as modules and combine pre-trained modules with untrained modules, to learn the shift in distributions between data sets. The central impact of using a modular approach comes from adding new representations to a network, as opposed to replacing representations via fine-tuning. Using this technique, we are able surpass results using standard fine-tuning transfer learning approaches, and we are also able to significantly increase performance over such approaches when using smaller amounts of data.  "
Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization,"We present two novel and contrasting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents. The Classifier based architecture sequentially accepts or rejects each sentence in the original document order for its membership in the summary. The Selector architecture, on the other hand, is free to pick one sentence at a time in any arbitrary order to generate the extractive summary. 

Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences. In addition, these models have the advantage of being very interpretable, since they allow visualization of their predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and redundancy. 

We show that our models reach or outperform state-of-the-art supervised models on two different corpora. We also recommend the conditions under which one architecture is superior to the other based on experimental evidence."
Deep Information Propagation,"We study the behavior of untrained neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly distributed using mean field theory. We show the existence of depth scales that naturally limit the maximum depth of signal propagation through these random networks. Our main practical result is to show that random networks may be trained precisely when information can travel through them. Thus, the depth scales that we identify provide bounds on how deep a network may be trained for a specific choice of hyperparameters. As a corollary to this, we argue that in networks at the edge of chaos, one of these depth scales diverges. Thus arbitrarily deep networks may be trained only sufficiently close to criticality. We show that the presence of dropout destroys the order-to-chaos critical point and therefore strongly limits the maximum trainable depth for random networks. Finally, we develop a mean field theory for backpropagation and we show that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradient respectively."
FractalNet: Ultra-Deep Neural Networks without Residuals,"We introduce a design strategy for neural network macro-architecture based on self-similarity.  Repeated application of a simple expansion rule generates deep networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals.  These networks contain interacting subpaths of different lengths, but do not include any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers.  In experiments, fractal networks match the state-of-the-art performance held by residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks.  Rather, the key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep.  We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures.  Such regularization allows extraction of high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks.  Additionally, fractal networks exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer."
Perception Updating Networks: On architectural constraints for interpretable video generative models,"We investigate a neural network architecture and statistical framework that models frames in videos using principles inspired by computer graphics pipelines. The proposed model explicitly represents ""sprites"" or its percepts inferred from maximum likelihood of the scene and infers its movement independently of its content. We impose architectural constraints that forces resulting architecture to behave as a recurrent what-where prediction network."
Neural Data Filter for Bootstrapping Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Mini-batch based Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) has been widely used to train deep neural networks efficiently. In this paper, we design a general framework to automatically and adaptively select training data for SGD. The framework is based on neural networks and we call it \emph{\textbf{N}eural \textbf{D}ata \textbf{F}ilter} (\textbf{NDF}). In Neural Data Filter, the whole training process of the original neural network is monitored and supervised by a deep reinforcement network, which controls whether to filter some data in sequentially arrived mini-batches so as to maximize future accumulative reward (e.g., validation accuracy). The SGD process accompanied with NDF is able to use less data and converge faster while achieving comparable accuracy as the standard SGD trained on the full dataset. Our experiments demonstrates that NDF significantly bootstraps SGD training for Recurrent Neural Network applied to sentiment classification."
Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests,"The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \sim P^n$ and $S_Q \sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution.  Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis ``$P = Q$'' is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level.  As we will show, such \emph{Classifier Two-Sample Tests} (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ.

The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST.  First, we analyze their main theoretical properties.  Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives.  Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery."
Tartan: Accelerating Fully-Connected and Convolutional Layers in Deep Learning Networks by Exploiting Numerical Precision Variability,"Tartan {TRT} a hardware accelerator for inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is presented and evaluated on Convolutional Neural Networks. TRT exploits the variable per layer precision requirements of DNNs to deliver execution time that is proportional to the precision p in bits used per layer for convolutional and fully-connected layers. Prior art has demonstrated an accelerator with the same execution performance only for convolutional layers. Experiments on image classification CNNs show that on average across all networks studied,  TRT outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator by 1.90x without any loss in accuracy while it is 1.17x more energy efficient. TRT requires no network retraining while it enables trading off accuracy for additional improvements in execution performance and energy efficiency. For example, if a 1% relative loss in accuracy is acceptable, TRT is on average 2.04x faster and 1.25x more energy efficient than the bit-parallel accelerator."
Machine Solver for Physics Word Problems,"We build a machine solver for word problems on the physics of a free
falling object under constant acceleration of gravity.  Each problem
consists of a formulation part, describing the setting, and a question
part asking for the value of an unknown.  Our solver consists of
two long short-term memory recurrent neural networks and a numerical
integrator. The first neural network (the labeler) labels each
word of the problem, identifying the physical parameters and the
question part of the problem. The second neural network (the 
classifier) identifies what is being asked in the question. Using
the information extracted by both networks, the numerical integrator
computes the solution.  We observe that the classifier is resilient
to errors made by the labeler, which does a better job of identifying
the physics parameters than the question. Training, validation and test
sets of problems are generated from a grammar, with validation and test
problems structurally different from the training problems. The overall
accuracy of the solver on the test cases is 99.8%."
Learning Word-Like Units from Joint Audio-Visual Analylsis,"Given a collection of images and spoken audio captions, we present a method for discovering word-like acoustic units in the continuous speech signal and grounding them to semantically relevant image regions. For example, our model is able to detect spoken instances of the words ``lighthouse'' within an utterance and associate them with image regions containing lighthouses. We do not use any form of conventional automatic speech recognition, nor do we use any text transcriptions or conventional linguistic annotations. Our model effectively implements a form of spoken language acquisition, in which the computer learns not only to recognize word categories by sound, but also to enrich the words it learns with semantics by grounding them in images."
Topology and Geometry of Half-Rectified Network Optimization,"The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest 
in the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of 
high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using spin glass 
models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model.

In this work, we do not make any such approximation and study conditions 
on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence 
of bad local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two 
important folklore facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology 
from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii) that the energy landscape 
in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay.

The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address. 
We study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce
an algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale networks. 
Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected throughout 
all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they become 
exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to what is observed in practice with 
very low curvature attractors."
Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement Learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral patterns for sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally, such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating it.
FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm which maintains an explicit policy estimate  by enabling temporal abstractions in the action space and implicitly enabling planning through sequences of repetitive macro-actions.  
We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600 domain, Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mujoco domain and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients in the TORCS car racing domain.

Multi-modal Variational Encoder-Decoders,"Recent advances in neural variational inference have facilitated efficient training of powerful directed graphical models with continuous latent variables, such as variational autoencoders. However, these models usually assume simple, uni-modal priors — such as the multivariate Gaussian distribution — yet many real-world data distributions are highly complex and multi-modal. Example of complex and multi-modal distributions range from topics in newswire text to conversational dialogue responses. When such latent variable models are applied to these domains, the restriction of the simple, uni-modal prior hinders the overall expressivity of the learned model as it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution. To overcome this critical restriction, we propose a flexible, simple prior distribution which can be learned efficiently and potentially capture an exponential number of modes of a target distribution. We develop the multi-modal variational encoder-decoder framework and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed prior in several natural language processing modeling tasks, including document modeling and dialogue modeling."
Loss-aware Binarization of Deep Networks,"Deep neural network models, though very powerful and highly successful, are computationally expensive in terms of space and time. Recently, there have been a number of attempts on binarizing the network weights and activations. This greatly reduces the network size, and replaces the underlying multiplications to additions or even XNOR bit operations. However, existing binarization schemes are based on simple matrix approximation and ignore the effect of binarization on the loss. In this paper, we propose a proximal Newton algorithm with diagonal Hessian approximation that directly minimizes the loss w.r.t. the binarized weights. The underlying proximal step has an efficient closed-form solution, and the second-order information can be efficiently obtained from the second moments already computed by the Adam optimizer. Experiments on both feedforward and recurrent networks show that the proposed loss-aware binarization algorithm outperforms existing binarization schemes, and is also more robust for wide and deep networks."
Learning to Play in a Day: Faster Deep Reinforcement Learning by Optimality Tightening,"We propose a novel training algorithm for reinforcement learning which combines the strength of deep Q-learning with a constrained optimization approach to tighten optimality and encourage faster reward propagation. Our novel technique makes deep reinforcement learning more practical by drastically reducing the training time.  We evaluate the performance of our approach on the 49 games of the challenging Arcade  Learning Environment, and report significant improvements in both training time and accuracy."
Reference-Aware Language Models,"We propose a general class of language models that treat reference as an explicit stochastic latent variable. This architecture allows models to create mentions of entities and their attributes by accessing external databases (required by, e.g., dialogue generation and recipe generation) and internal state (required by, e.g. language models which are aware of coreference). This facilitates the incorporation of information that can be accessed in predictable locations in databases or dis- course context, even when the targets of the reference may be rare words. Experiments on three tasks show our model variants outperform models based on deterministic attention."
Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"We introduce the ""Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network"" model (EBGAN) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator is seen as being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the discriminator is trained to assign high energies to these generated samples. Viewing the discriminator as an energy function allows to use a wide variety of architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images."
Simple Black-Box Adversarial Perturbations for Deep Networks,"Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models that achieve state-of-the-art pattern recognition performance on many computer vision, speech, and language processing tasks. However, these networks have also been shown susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations which force misclassification of the inputs. Adversarial examples enable adversaries to subvert the expected system behavior leading to undesired consequences and could pose a security risk when these systems are deployed in the real world.

In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural networks and demonstrate that adversaries can easily craft adversarial examples even without any internal knowledge of the target network. Our attacks treat the network as an oracle (black-box) and only assume that the output of the network can be observed on the probed inputs. Our first attack is based on a simple idea of adding perturbation to a randomly selected single pixel or a small set of them. We then improve the effectiveness of this attack by carefully constructing a small set of pixels to perturb by using the idea of greedy local-search. Our proposed attacks also naturally extend to a stronger notion of misclassification. Our extensive experimental results illustrate that even these elementary attacks can reveal a deep neural network's vulnerabilities. The simplicity and effectiveness of our proposed schemes mean that they could serve as a litmus test while designing robust networks.

Unsupervised Pretraining for Sequence to Sequence Learning,"Sequence to sequence models are successful tools for supervised
sequence learning tasks, such as machine translation.
Despite their success, these models still require much labeled data
and it is unclear how to improve them using unlabeled data, which is
much less expensive to obtain.  In this paper, we present simple
changes that lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of
seq2seq models when the labeled set is small. Our method
intializes the encoder and decoder of the
seq2seq model with the trained
weights of two language models, and then all weights are jointly
fine-tuned with labeled data. An additional language
modeling loss can be used to regularize the model during
fine-tuning. We apply this method to low-resource tasks in machine
translation and abstractive summarization and find that it
significantly improves the subsequent supervised models.
Our main finding is that the pretraining accelerates training and improves
generalization of seq2seq models,
achieving state-of-the-art results on the WMT
English->German task. Our model obtains an improvement of 1.3
BLEU from the previous best models on both WMT'14 and WMT'15
English->German. Our ablation study shows that pretraining
helps seq2seq models in different ways depending on the nature of the
task: translation benefits from the improved
generalization whereas summarization benefits from the improved
optimization."
BIOACOUSTIC SOUND SCENE REPRESENTATION BY HIERARCHICAL DIRICHLET PROCESS FOR HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL,"Understanding communication or interpreting different animal signals is an important topic in bioacoustics research. We investigate probabilistic models on real-world bioacoustic sound scenes to represent the signal. We study sequential models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); HMM is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This pa- per illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand and interpret such species."
Surprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.

Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning,"The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered. In particular a new regularization method (CMD) is proposed that is based on differences of higher order central moments. CMD is used to minimize the domain discrepancy of the latent feature representations explicitly in the hidden activation space.
In contrast to standard approaches, e.g. ”Maximum Mean Discrepancy” (MMD), computationally expensive distance- and kernel matrix computations are unnecessary. We define CMD to be an empirical estimate of a new metric introduced in this paper. We prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w.r.t. to the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables.
We test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Office) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews). CMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks of Office and outperforms networks trained with MMD, variational fair autoencoders and domain adversarial neural networks on Amazon reviews. In addition, a post-hoc parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the new approach is stable w.r.t. parameter changes in a certain interval. The source code is publicly available."
Learning Recurrent Span Representations for Extractive Question Answering,"The reading comprehension task, that asks questions about a given evidence document, is a central problem in natural language understanding. Recent formulations of this task have typically focused on answer selection from a set of candidates pre-defined manually or through the use of an external NLP pipeline. However, Rajpurkar et al. (2016) recently released the SQUAD dataset in which the answers can be arbitrary strings from the supplied text. In this paper, we focus on this answer extraction task, presenting a novel model architecture that efficiently builds fixed length representations of all spans in the evidence document with a recurrent network. We show that scoring explicit span representations significantly improves performance over other approaches that factor the prediction into separate predictions about words or start and end markers. Our approach improves upon the best published results of Wang & Jiang (2016) by 5% and decreases the error of Rajpurkar et al.’s baseline by > 50%."
A Neural Stochastic Volatility Model,"In this paper, we show that the recent integration of statistical models with recurrent neural networks provides a new way of formulating volatility models that have been popular in time series analysis and prediction. The model comprises a pair of complementary stochastic recurrent neural networks: the generative network models the joint distribution of the stochastic volatility process; the inference network approximates the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observable ones.
Our focus in this paper is on the formulation of temporal dynamics of volatility over time under a stochastic recurrent neural network framework. Our derivations show that some popular volatility models are a special case of our proposed neural stochastic volatility model. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model generates a smoother volatility estimation, and largely outperforms a widely used GARCH model on several metrics about the fitness of the volatility modelling and the accuracy of the prediction."
Incremental Network Quantization: Towards Lossless CNNs with Low-precision Weights,"This paper presents a novel method named incremental network quantization (INQ), targeting to efficiently transform any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose connection weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike related methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, INQ has the potential of resolving this common issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base of the original model, thus they are quantized into low-precision ones by a mapping function, while the weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss due to quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained weight group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted to low-precision ones, acting as an incremental quantization and enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed INQ. Specifically, at 5-bit (i.e., 4 bits for powers of two plus 1 bit for zero) quantization, it yields improved accuracy when compared with the 32-bit floating-point references, shedding new insight on how to make deep CNNs to be applicable on mobile or embedded devices. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights also have improved or very similar accuracy as its 32-bit floating-point baseline. The code will be made publicly available."
Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"The activation function is an important component in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For instance, recent breakthroughs in Deep Learning can be attributed to the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Another recently proposed activation function, the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), has the supplementary property of reducing bias shift without explicitly centering the values at zero. In this paper, we show that learning a parameterization of ELU improves its performance. We analyzed our proposed Parametric ELU (PELU) in the context of vanishing gradients and provide a gradient-based optimization framework. We conducted several experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet with different network architectures, such as NiN, Overfeat, All-CNN and ResNet. Our results show that our PELU has relative error improvements over ELU of 4.45% and 5.68% on CIFAR-10 and 100, and as much as 7.28% with only 0.0003% parameter increase on ImageNet. We also observed that Vgg using PELU tended to prefer activations saturating closer to zero, as in ReLU, except at the last layer, which saturated near -2. Finally, other presented results suggest that varying the shape of the activations during training along with the other parameters helps controlling vanishing gradients and bias shift, thus facilitating learning."
Learning in Implicit Generative Models,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers. Here, we develop  our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models---models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data---and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding  in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination."
Unsupervised Deep Learning of State Representation Using Robotic Priors ,"Our understanding of the world depends highly on how we represent it.  Using background knowledge about its complex underlying physical rules, our brain can produce intuitive and simplified representations which it can easily use to solve problems. The approach of this paper aims to reproduce this simplification process using a neural network to produce a simple low dimensional state representation of the world from images acquired by a robot. As proposed in Jonschkowski & Brock (2015), we train the neural network in an unsupervised way, using the ""a priori"" knowledge we have about the world as loss functions called ""robotic priors"" that we implemented through a siamese network. This approach has been used to learn a one dimension representation of a Baxter head position from raw images. The experiment resulted in a 97,7% correlation between the learned representation and the ground truth, and show that relevant visual features form the environment are learned."
Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,"This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks that is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape at solutions found by gradient descent. Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local entropy based objective that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in the flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD, where we use Langevin dynamics to compute the gradient of local entropy at each update of the weights. We prove that incorporating local entropy into the objective function results in a smoother energy landscape and use uniform stability to show improved generalization bounds over SGD. Our experiments on competitive baselines demonstrate that Entropy-SGD leads to improved generalization and has the potential to accelerate training."
Deep Multi-task Representation Learning: A Tensor Factorisation Approach,"Most contemporary multi-task learning methods assume linear models. This setting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, we present a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach is based on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly or implicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, to realise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks. This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need a user-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to both homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our deep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy and fewer design choices."
Coarse Pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks with Random Masks,"The learning capability of a neural network improves with increasing depth at
higher computational costs. Wider layers with dense kernel connectivity patterns
further increase this cost and may hinder real-time inference. We propose feature
map and kernel level pruning for reducing the computational complexity of
a deep convolutional neural network. Pruning feature maps reduces the width
of a layer and hence does not need any sparse representation. Further, kernel
pruning changes the dense connectivity pattern into a sparse one. Due to coarse
nature, these pruning granularities can be exploited by GPUs and VLSI based
implementations. We propose a simple strategy to choose the least adversarial
pruning masks. The proposed approach is generic and can select good pruning
masks for feature map, kernel and intra-kernel pruning. The pruning masks are
generated randomly, and the best performing one is selected using the evaluation
set. The sufficient number of random pruning masks to try depends on the pruning
ratio, and is around 100 when 40% complexity reduction is needed. The pruned
network is retrained to compensate for the loss in accuracy. We have extensively
evaluated the proposed approach with the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets.
Experiments with the CIFAR-10 dataset show that more than 85% sparsity can be
induced in the convolution layers with less than 1% increase in the misclassification
rate of the baseline network."
Adaptive Feature Abstraction for Translating Video to Language,"A new model for video captioning is developed, using a deep three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (C3D) as an encoder for videos and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as a decoder for captions. We consider both ``hard'' and ``soft'' attention mechanisms, to adaptively and sequentially focus on different layers of features (levels of feature ``abstraction''), as well as local spatiotemporal regions of the feature maps at each layer. The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: YouTube2Text, M-VAD and MSR-VTT.  Along with visualizing the results and how the model works, these experiments quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive spatiotemporal feature abstraction for translating videos to sentences with rich semantics."
Sample Efficient Actor-Critic with  Experience Replay,"This paper presents an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning agent with experience replay that is stable, sample efficient, and performs remarkably well on challenging environments, including the discrete 57-game Atari domain and several continuous control problems. To achieve this, the paper introduces several innovations, including truncated importance sampling with bias correction, stochastic dueling network architectures, and a new trust region policy optimization method."
ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"The ability to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation in real-time is of paramount importance in practical mobile applications. Recent deep neural networks aimed at this task have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of floating point operations and have long run-times that hinder their usability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet (efficient neural network), created specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. ENet is up to 18x faster, requires 75x less FLOPs, has 79x less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models.           
We have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster.

Understanding trained CNNs by indexing neuron selectivity,"The impressive performance and plasticity of convolutional neural networks to solve different vision problems are shadowed by their black-box nature and its consequent lack of full understanding. To reduce this gap we propose to describe the activity of individual neurons by quantifiyng their inherent selectivity to specific properties. Our approach is based on the definition of feature selectivity indexes that allow the ranking of neurons according to specific properties. Here we report the results of exploring selectivity indexes for: (a) an image feature (color); and (b) an image label (class membership). Our contribution is a framework to seek or classify neurons by indexing on these selectivity properties. It helps to find color selective neurons, such as a red-mushroom neuron in layer conv4 or class selective neurons such as dog-face neurons in layer conv5, and establishes a methodology to derive other selectivity properties.  Indexing on neuron selectivity can statistically draw how features and classes are represented through layers at a moment when the size of trained nets is growing and automatic tools to index can be helpful. "
Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning,"In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for training deep neural networks in a semi-supervised setting where only a small portion of training data is labeled. We introduce self-ensembling, where we form a consensus prediction of the unknown labels using the outputs of the network-in-training on different epochs, and most importantly, under different regularization and input augmentation conditions. This ensemble prediction can be expected to be a better predictor for the unknown labels than the output of the network at the most recent training epoch, and can thus be used as a target for training. Using our method, we set new records for two standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, reducing the (non-augmented) classification error rate from 18.44% to 7.05% in SVHN with 500 labels and from 18.63% to 16.55% in CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels, and further to 5.12% and 12.16% by enabling the standard augmentations. We additionally demonstrate good tolerance to incorrect labels.
"
Multiagent System for Layer Free Network,"We propose a multiagent system that have feedforward networks as its subset 
while free from layer structure with matrix-vector scheme.
Deep networks are often compared to the brain neocortex or visual perception system.
One of the largest difference from human brain is the use of matrix-vector multiplication based on layer architecture.
It would help understanding the way human brain works
if we manage to develop good deep network model without the layer architecture while preserving their performance.
The brain neocortex works as an aggregation of the local level interactions between neurons, 
which is rather similar to multiagent system consists of autonomous partially observing agents
than units aligned in column vectors and manipulated by global level algorithm.
Therefore we suppose that it is an effective approach for developing more biologically plausible model while preserving compatibility with deep networks to alternate units with multiple agents.
Our method also has advantage in scalability and memory efficiency.
We reimplemented Stacked Denoising Autoencoder(SDAE) as a concrete instance with our multiagent system and verified its equivalence with the standard SDAE from both theoritical and empirical perspectives.
Additionary, we also proposed a variant of our multiagent SDAE named ""Sparse Connect SDAE"",
and showed its computational advantage with the MNIST dataset."
Classless Association using Neural Networks,"The goal of this paper is to train a model based on the relation between two instances that represent the same \emph{unknown} class. We propose a novel model called Classless Association. It has two parallel Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) that uses one network as a target of the other network, and vice versa. In addition, the presented model is trained based on an EM-approach, in which the output vectors are matched against a statistical distribution. We generate a dataset based on MNIST, where the input is two different instances of the same digit and the dataset has a uniform distribution of the digits. Furthermore, our classless association model is evaluated against two scenarios: totally supervised and totally unsupervised. In the first scenario, our model reaches a good performance in terms of accuracy and the classless data. In the second scenario, our model reaches better results against two clustering algorithms."
On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations,"Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we propose to augment deep neural networks with a small ``detector'' subnetwork which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust.  We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the detector that counteracts this attack. "
Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data,"This paper presents a method of learning distributed representation for multi-field categorical data, which is a common data format with various applications such as recommender systems, social link prediction, and computational advertising. The success of non-linear models, e.g., factorisation machines, boosted trees, has proved the potential of exploring the interactions among inter-field categories. Inspired by Word2Vec, the distributed representation for natural language, we propose Cat2Vec (categories to vectors) model. In Cat2Vec, a low-dimensional continuous vector is automatically learned for each category in each field. The interactions among inter-field categories are further explored by different neural gates and the most informative ones are selected by pooling layers. In our experiments, with the exploration of the interactions between pairwise categories over layers, the model attains great improvement over state-of-the-art models in a supervised learning task, e.g., click prediction, while capturing the most significant interactions from the data. "
Q-Prop: Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient with An Off-Policy Critic,"Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is the high sample complexity of such methods. Unbiased batch policy-gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches, while TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of unbiased policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments."
On Robust Concepts and Small Neural Nets,"The universal approximation theorem for neural networks says that any reasonable function is well-approximated by a two-layer neural network with sigmoid gates but it does not provide good bounds on the number of hidden-layer nodes or the weights. However, robust concepts often have small neural networks in practice. We show an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem on the boolean hypercube in this context.

We prove that any noise-stable boolean function on n boolean-valued input variables can be well-approximated by a two-layer linear threshold circuit with a small number of hidden-layer nodes and small weights, that depend only on the noise-stability and approximation parameters, and are independent of n. We also give a polynomial time learning algorithm that outputs a small two-layer linear threshold circuit that approximates such a given function. We also show weaker generalizations of this to noise-stable polynomial threshold functions and noise-stable boolean functions in general."
Transformational Sparse Coding,"
A fundamental problem faced by object recognition systems is that
objects and their features can appear in different locations, scales
and orientations. Current deep learning methods attempt to achieve
invariance to local translations via pooling, discarding the locations
of features in the process.  Other approaches explicitly learn
transformed versions of the same feature, leading to representations
that quickly explode in size. Instead of discarding the rich and
useful information about feature transformations to achieve
invariance, we argue that models should learn object features
conjointly with their transformations to achieve equivariance.  We
propose a new model of unsupervised learning based on sparse coding
that can learn object features jointly with their affine
transformations directly from images. Results based on learning from
natural images indicate that our approach
matches the reconstruction quality of traditional sparse coding but
with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while simultaneously
learning transformations from data. These results open the door to
scaling up unsupervised learning to allow deep feature+transformation
learning in a manner consistent with the ventral+dorsal stream
architecture of the primate visual cortex."
RenderGAN: Generating Realistic Labeled Data,"Deep Convolutional Neuronal Networks (DCNNs) are showing remarkable performance on many computer vision tasks.  Due to their large parameter space, they require many labeled samples when trained in a supervised setting. The costs of annotating data manually can render the usage of DCNNs infeasible.  We present a novel framework called RenderGAN that can generate large amounts of realistic, labeled images by combining a 3D model and the Generative Adversarial Network framework. In our approach, image augmentations (e.g. lighting, background, and detail) are learned from unlabeled data such that the generated images are strikingly realistic while preserving the labels known from the 3D model.  We apply the RenderGAN framework to generate images of barcode-like markers that are attached to honeybees.  A DCNN is trained on this data only. It performs better on a test set of real data than an equal DCNN trained on the limited amounts of real data available."
Training deep neural-networks using a noise adaptation layer,"The availability of large datsets has enabled neural networks to achieve impressive recognition results. However, the presence of inaccurate class labels is known  to deteriorate the performance of even the best classifiers in a broad range of classification problems. Noisy labels also  tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes. When the observed label is noisy, we can view the correct label as a latent random variable and model the noise processes by a communication channel with unknown parameters. Thus we can apply the EM algorithm to find the parameters of both the network and the noise  and to estimate the correct label. In this study we present a neural-network approach that optimizes  the same likelihood function as optimized by the EM algorithm. The noise is explicitly modeled by an additional softmax layer that connects the correct labels to the noisy ones. This scheme is then extended  to the case where the noisy labels are dependent  on the features in addition to the correct labels.  Experimental results demonstrate that this approach  outperforms previous methods.
"
Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"The question of how procedural knowledge is represented and inferred is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recent work on program induction has proposed neural architectures, based on abstractions like stacks, Turing machines, and interpreters,  that operate on abstract computational machines or on execution traces. But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation  on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.
"
Learning to Compose Words into Sentences with Reinforcement Learning,"We use reinforcement learning to learn
tree-structured neural networks for computing representations of natural language sentences.
In contrast with prior work on tree-structured models, in which the trees are either provided as input or
predicted using supervision from explicit treebank annotations,
the tree structures in this work are optimized to improve performance on a downstream task.
Experiments demonstrate the benefit of
learning task-specific composition orders, outperforming both sequential encoders and recursive encoders based on treebank annotations.
We analyze the induced trees and show that while they discover
some linguistically intuitive structures (e.g., noun phrases, simple verb phrases),
they are different than conventional English syntactic structures."
"LARGE SCALE METRIC LEARNING,  A VOYAGE FROM SHALLOW TO DEEP","Despite its attractive properties, the recently introduced Keep It Simple and Straightforward MEtric learning (KISSME) method is very reliant on PCA to prepare neat input data. This dependency can lead to difficulties, e.g., when the dimensionality is not meticulously set. To address this issue, we devise a unified formulation for joint dimensionality reduction and metric learning based on the KISSME algorithm. Our joint formulation is expressed as an optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, hence enjoys properties of Riemannian optimization techniques. We also devise end-to-end learning of a generic deep network for metric learning using our derivation."
Cortical-Inspired Open-Bigram Representation for Handwritten Word Recognition,"Recent research in the cognitive process of reading hypothesized that we do
not read words by sequentially recognizing letters, but rather by identifing
open-bigrams, i.e. couple of letters that are not necessarily next
to each other. 
In this paper, we evaluate an handwritten word recognition method based on original
open-bigrams representation. We trained Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks
(LSTM-RNNs) to predict open-bigrams rather than characters, and we show that
such models are able to learn the long-range, complicated and intertwined dependencies
in the input signal, necessary to the prediction. 
For decoding, we decomposed each word of a large vocabulary into the set of
constituent bigrams, and apply a simple cosine similarity measure between this 
representation and the bagged RNN prediction to retrieve the vocabulary word. 
We compare this method to standard word recognition techniques based on 
sequential character recognition.
Experiments are carried out on two public databases of handwritten words
(Rimes and IAM), an the results with our bigram decoder are comparable 
to more conventional decoding methods based on sequences of letters."
Representation of uncertainty in deep neural networks through sampling,"As deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to increasingly challenging problems, they will need to be able to represent their own uncertainty. Modeling uncertainty is one of the key features of Bayesian methods. Scalable Bayesian DNNs that use dropout-based variational distributions have recently been proposed. Here we evaluate the ability of Bayesian DNNs trained with Bernoulli or Gaussian distributions over units (dropout) or weights (dropconnect) to estimate their own uncertainty at the time of inference through sampling. We tested how well Bayesian fully connected and convolutional DNNs represented their own uncertainty in classifying the MNIST handwritten digits. By adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the test images, we assessed how DNNs represented their uncertainty about regions of input space not covered by the training set. Bayesian DNNs estimated their own uncertainty more accurately than traditional DNNs with a softmax output. These results are important for building better deep learning systems and for investigating the hypothesis that biological neural networks use sampling to represent uncertainty."
Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks,"An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures. These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system."
Semi-supervised deep learning by metric embedding,"Deep networks are successfully used as classification models yielding state-of-the-art results when trained on a large number of labeled samples. These models, however, are usually much less suited for semi-supervised problems because of their tendency to overfit easily when trained on small amounts of data. In this work we will explore a new training objective that is targeting a semi-supervised regime with only a small subset of labeled data. This criterion is based on a deep metric embedding over distance relations within the set of labeled samples, together with constraints over the embeddings of the unlabeled set. The final learned representations are discriminative in euclidean space, and hence can be used with subsequent nearest-neighbor classification using the labeled samples."
Making Stochastic Neural Networks from Deterministic Ones,"It has been believed that stochastic feedforward neural networks (SFNN) have several advantages beyond deterministic deep neural networks (DNN): they have more expressive power allowing multi-modal mappings and regularize better due to their stochastic nature. However, training SFNN is notoriously harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for large-scale SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNN and approximates certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three models, i.e., DNN
-> Simplified-SFNN -> SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. In particular, our stochastic model built from the wide residual network has 28 layers and 36 million parameters, where the former consistently outperforms the latter for the classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 due to its stochastic regularizing effect."
Identity Matters in Deep Learning,"An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a deep
artificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity
transformation. This idea not only motivated various normalization techniques,
such as batch normalization, but was also key to the immense success of
residual networks.

In this work, we put the principle of identity parameterization on a more 
solid theoretical footing alongside further empirical progress. We first
give a strikingly simple proof that arbitrarily deep linear residual networks
have no spurious local optima. The same result for feed-forward networks in
their standard parameterization is substantially more delicate.  Second, we
show that residual networks with ReLu activations have universal finite-sample
expressivity in the sense that the network can represent any function of its
sample provided that the model has more parameters than the sample size.

Directly inspired by our theory, we experiment with a radically simple
residual architecture consisting of only residual convolutional layers and
ReLu activations, but no batch normalization, dropout, or max pool. Our model
improves significantly on previous all-convolutional networks on the CIFAR10,
CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification benchmarks.

Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise,"We introduce Information Dropout, a generalization of dropout that is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and highlights the way in which injecting noise in the activations can help in learning optimal representations of the data. Information Dropout is rooted in information theoretic principles, it includes as special cases several existing dropout methods, like Gaussian Dropout and Variational Dropout, and, unlike classical dropout, it can learn and build representations that are invariant to nuisances of the data, like occlusions and clutter. When the task is the reconstruction of the input, we show that the information dropout method yields a variational autoencoder as a special case, thus providing a link between representation learning, information theory and variational inference. Our experiments validate the theoretical intuitions behind our method, and we find that information dropout achieves a comparable or better generalization performance than binary dropout, especially on smaller models, since it can automatically adapt the noise to the structure of the network, as well as to the test sample."
ReasoNet: Learning to Stop Reading in Machine Comprehension,"Teaching a computer to read a document and answer general questions pertaining to the document is a challenging yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a novel neural network architecture called Reasoning Network ({ReasoNet}) for machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNet makes use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNet introduces a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNet can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and a structured Graph Reachability dataset. 
"
Adversarial Feature Learning,"The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing generators learn to ""linearize semantics"" in the latent space of such models. Intuitively, such latent spaces may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning."
Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding,"Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks. However, the increasing complexity of the problems, as well as the use of more sophisticated models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), impedes the understanding of artificial agents behavior. In this work, we present the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The purpose of the SAMDP modeling is to describe and allow a better understanding of complex behaviors by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions. In contrast to other modeling approaches, SAMDP is built in a transformed state-space that encodes the dynamics of the problem. We show that working with the \emph{right} state representation mitigates the problem of finding spatial and temporal abstractions. We describe the process of building the SAMDP model from observed trajectories and give examples for using it in a toy problem and complicated DQN policies. Finally, we show how using the SAMDP we can monitor the policy at hand and make it more robust."
Deep Symbolic Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Time-series Classification,"In this paper, we consider the problem of event classification with multi-variate time series data consisting of heterogeneous (continuous and categorical) variables. The complex temporal dependencies between the variables combined with sparsity of the data makes the event classification problem particularly challenging. Most state-of-art approaches address this either by designing hand-engineered features or breaking up the problem over homogeneous variates. In this work, we propose and compare three representation learning algorithms over symbolized sequences which enables classification of heterogeneous time-series data using a deep architecture. The proposed representations are trained jointly along with the rest of the network architecture in an end-to-end fashion that makes the learned features discriminative for the given task. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."
A Way out of the Odyssey: Analyzing and Combining Recent Insights for LSTMs,"LSTMs have become a basic building block for many deep NLP models. In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of architectural modifications for LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets. We observe compounding improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, deep vector averaging (DVA), and residual connections, along with four other suggested modifications. Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality baseline model."
Towards the Limit of Network Quantization,"Network quantization is one of network compression techniques employed to reduce the redundancy of deep neural networks. It compresses the size of the storage for a large number of network parameters in a neural network by quantizing them and encoding the quantized values into binary codewords of smaller sizes. In this paper, we aim to design network quantization schemes that minimize the expected loss due to quantization while maximizing the compression ratio. To this end, we analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the loss function of a neural network and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function that we need to optimize for minimizing the loss due to quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize when fixed-length binary encoding follows. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression of quantized values after clustering, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative algorithm similar to Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, our experiment results show that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable (i.e., the sizes of the compressed models are 1.95%, 4.51% and 2.46% of the original model sizes) for LeNet, ResNet and AlexNet, respectively, at no or marginal performance loss."
Binary Paragraph Vectors,"Recently Le & Mikolov described two log-linear models, called Paragraph Vector, that can be used to learn state-of-the-art distributed representations of documents. Inspired by this work, we present Binary Paragraph Vectors: simple neural networks that learn short binary codes for fast information retrieval. We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based binary codes, despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that Binary Paragraph Vectors can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents. Finally, we present a model that simultaneously learns short binary codes and longer, real-valued representations. This model can be used to rapidly retrieve a short list of highly relevant documents from a large document collection."
Multitask Regularization for Semantic Vector Representation of Phrases,"Deep learning based models help generate semantic vector representations for unigrams, phrases, and long text. However, such vectors have to be custom trained for each specific scenario. Training such models become impractical in the presence of small amounts of data which is the case in multiple real world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel regularization scheme for such representation using multi-task learning. Learning across different tasks makes the system learn general purpose representation for phrases and sentences. We demonstrate the application of the learned representation by applying them in intent identification and entity tagging. In this case, the trained models use one-shot learning (learning using a single or few examples) to identify multiple intents in natural language sentences. We also show that the learned vectors produce state-of-the-art results for identifying terms weights for queries in an information retrieval application relating to a commercial search engine. Additionally, we present an {\it incremental} multi-task learning architecture to learn more accurate representation targeting tasks which are quite different from the ones on which the model is initially trained."
Generative Paragraph Vector,"The recently introduced Paragraph Vector is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed representations for pieces of texts. However, an inherent limitation of Paragraph Vector is lack of ability to infer distributed representations for texts outside of the training set. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Generative Paragraph Vector, which can be viewed as a probabilistic extension of the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector with a complete generative process. With the ability to infer the distributed representations for unseen texts, we can further incorporate text labels into the model and turn it into a supervised version, namely Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector. In this way, we can leverage the labels paired with the texts to guide the representation learning, and employ the learned model for prediction tasks directly. Experiments on five text classification benchmark collections show that both model architectures can yield superior classification performance over the state-of-the-art counterparts.
"
Modularized Morphing of Neural Networks,"In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved. Different from existing work where basic morphing types on the layer level were addressed, we target at the central problem of network morphism at a higher level, i.e., how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module of a neural network. To simplify the representation of a network, we abstract a module as a graph with blobs as vertices and convolutional layers as edges, based on which the morphing process is able to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced to compose the graphs, based on which modules are classified into two families, i.e., simple morphable modules and complex modules. We present practical morphing solutions for both of these two families, and prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on the state-of-the-art ResNet on benchmark datasets, and the effectiveness of the proposed solution has been verified."
Intermediate Layers of Neural Networks Discover Subclass Concepts With Priors,"The most successful deep neural networks in recent years are supervisedly
trained. It associates complex patterns of input samples to hidden neurons in
the last layer, which form representations of {\it concepts}, based on training
objectives that directly {\it associate} training samples with their semantic
labels. These hidden neurons are subsequently fed to a classifier to produce
estimates of semantic labels. In spite of their successes, the properties of
these learned associations remain elusive. In this work, we exploit
unsupervised group symmetry priors in the semantic space of the higher layers
of neural networks that associate input samples with concepts. We investigate a
relaxed problem where classes of training samples are organized into common or
super classes, and establish proper association priors to implicitly learn sub-class
concepts with only super-class labels. The priors both associate the last layer
of a network, which corresponds to concepts of super classes, with the
penultimate one that corresponds to concepts of sub-classes, and builds up
interactions among neurons of the penultimate layer. The second prior organizes
neurons in the penultimate layer according to their group symmetries of super classes, and
endorses competition priors among each group. Experiments show that our
proposed scheme enables neurons of the penultimate layer to discover clusters
of samples that are particularly relevant to sub-classes. More specifically,
when using discovered neurons to classify test samples, we obtain
classification performance that is far beyond the accuracy of chance and
approaches that of fully supervised learning. In contrast, no clusters relevant
to sub-classes emerge from internal neurons of neural networks without using
our proposed association priors."
(F)SPCD: Fast Regularization of PCD by Optimizing Stochastic ML Approximation under Gaussian Noise,"We propose a sparse persistent contrastive divergence (SPCD) and further fast SPCD (FSPCD) in restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) training for regularizing deep belief networks (DBN). 
At each weight update step in an RBM training process, we adopt the concept of adding Gaussian noise to Markov chain in the calculation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). 
By optimizing maximum likelihood given noise in the expectation over model, our algorithms ensure models to be more robust than other standard contrastive divergence (CD) algorithms. 
We have performed empirical investigation of diverse CD based approaches and have found encouraging results; both of our proposed methods show comparable and often higher classification performance on several benchmark tasks, yielding state-of the-art results in standard image classification tasks such as MNIST, rotation, and rectangle dataset.

Crossmap Dropout : A Generalization of Dropout Regularization in Convolution Level,"Training a deep neural network with a large number of parameters tends to lead to overfitting problem. 
Regularization is one method to prevent this problem. Nowadays, there are several regularization techniques and Dropout regularization is proven to be effective in most cases. 
It prevents overfitting by omitting some of the hidden units by a certain probability on each training case. 
In convolutional neural networks, Dropout are commonly applied only in fully connected layers and its effect on convolution layers is not thoroughly explored. 
We introduce Crossmap Dropout, a generalization of Dropout, for regularizing deep convolution layers. 
Instead of dropping individual units in each feature map in convolution layer, Crossmap Dropout randomly drops units in one feature map and applies the same pattern to all feature maps in the same convolution layer. 
We evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms regular Dropout, when applied in convolution layers.
"
Short and Deep: Sketching and Neural Networks,"Data-independent methods for dimensionality reduction such as random projections, sketches, and feature hashing have become increasingly popular in recent years.  These methods often seek to reduce dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class, resulting in inherent lower bounds on the size of projected data.  For example, preserving linear separability requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ dimensions, where $\gamma$ is the margin, and in the case of polynomial functions, the number of required dimensions has an exponential dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                            
Despite these limitations, we show that the dimensionality can be reduced further while maintaining performance guarantees, using improper learning with a slightly larger hypothesis class. In particular, we show that any sparse polynomial function of a sparse binary vector can be computed from a compact sketch by a single-layer neural network, where the sketch size has a logarithmic dependence on the polynomial degree.
                                                                                                                                                           
A practical consequence is that networks trained on sketched data are compact, and therefore suitable for settings with memory and power constraints. We empirically show that our approach leads to networks with fewer parameters than related methods such as feature hashing, at equal or better performance."
LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection,"In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems. In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems."
Faster CNNs with Direct Sparse Convolutions and Guided Pruning,"Phenomenally successful in practical inference problems, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely deployed in mobile devices, data centers, and even supercomputers.
The number of parameters needed in CNNs, however, are often large and undesirable. Consequently, various methods have been developed to prune a CNN once it is trained. 
Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable sparsity levels.

We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient general sparse-with-dense matrix
multiplication implementation that is applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1-7.3x convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon, and Xeon Phi processors, spanning the spectrum from mobile devices to supercomputers.

Deep Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis,"We present deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a deep multi-view learning model that extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear CCA~\citep{BachJordan05a} to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs). Computing the marginal data likelihood, as well as inference of the latent variables, are intractable under this model. We derive a variational lower bound of the data likelihood by parameterizing the posterior density of the latent variables with another DNN, and approximate the lower bound via Monte Carlo sampling. Interestingly, the resulting model resembles that of multi-view autoencoders~\citep{Ngiam_11b}, with the key distinction of an additional sampling procedure at the bottleneck layer. We also propose a variant of VCCA called VCCA-private which can, in addition to the ``common variables'' underlying both views, extract the ``private variables'' within each view. We demonstrate that VCCA-private is able to disentangle the shared and private information for multi-view data without hard supervision."
Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoders,"We extend Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes. This development allows us to define a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder that has a latent representation with stochastic dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE, and a semi-supervised variant, learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE’s."
Non-linear Dimensionality Regularizer for Solving Inverse Problems,"Consider an ill-posed inverse problem of estimating causal factors from observations, one of which is known to lie near some (unknown) low-dimensional, non-linear manifold expressed by a predefined Mercer-kernel. Solving this problem requires simultaneous estimation of these factors and learning the low-dimensional representation for them. In this work, we introduce a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving such problems without pre-training.
We re-formulate Kernel-PCA as an energy minimization problem in which low dimensionality constraints are introduced as regularization terms in the energy.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to create a dimensionality regularizer in the KPCA framework. Our approach relies on robustly penalizing the rank of the recovered factors directly in the implicit feature space to create
their low-dimensional approximations in closed form. Our approach performs robust KPCA in the presence of missing data and noise.
We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on predicting missing entries in the standard oil flow dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our method on the challenging problem of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion and our approach delivers promising results on CMU mocap dataset despite the presence of significant occlusions and noise."
Revisiting Batch Normalization For Practical Domain Adaptation,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown unprecedented success in various computer vision applications such as image classification and object detection. However, it is still a common annoyance during the training phase, that one has to prepare at least thousands of labeled images to fine-tune a network to a specific domain. Recent study shows that a DNN has strong dependency towards the training dataset, and the learned features cannot be easily transferred to a different but relevant task without fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful remedy, called Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN) to increase the generalization ability of a DNN. By modulating the statistics in all Batch Normalization layers across the network, our approach achieves deep adaptation effect for domain adaptation tasks. In contrary to other deep learning domain adaptation methods, our method does not require additional components, and is parameter-free. It archives state-of-the-art performance despite its surprising simplicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is complementary with other existing methods. Combining AdaBN with existing domain adaptation treatments may further improve model performance."
SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size,"Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet)."
Batch Policy Gradient  Methods for  Improving Neural Conversation Models,"We study reinforcement learning of chat-bots with recurrent neural network
architectures when the rewards are noisy and expensive to
obtain. For instance, a chat-bot used in automated customer service support can
be scored by quality assurance agents, but this process can be expensive, time consuming
and noisy. 
Previous reinforcement learning work for natural language uses on-policy updates
and/or is designed for on-line learning settings.
We demonstrate empirically that such strategies are not appropriate for this setting
and develop an off-policy batch policy gradient method (\bpg).
We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via a series of
synthetic experiments and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment on
a restaurant recommendations dataset.

Training Long Short-Term Memory With Sparsified Stochastic Gradient Descent,"Prior work has demonstrated that exploiting the sparsity can dramatically improve the energy efficiency and shrink the memory footprint of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
However, these sparsity-centric optimization techniques might be less effective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially for the training phase, because of the significant structural difference between the neurons. To investigate if there is possible sparsity-centric optimization for training LSTM-based RNNs, we studied several applications and observed that there is potential sparsity in the gradients generated in the backward propagation. In this paper, we illustrate why the sparsity exists and propose a simple yet effective thresholding technique to induce further more sparsity during training an LSTM-based RNN training. Experiment results show that the proposed technique can increase the sparsity of linear gate gradients to higher than 80\% without loss of performance, which makes more than 50\% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations redundant in an entire LSTM training process. These redudant MAC operations can be eliminated by hardware techniques to improve the energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM-based RNNs."
Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder,"Sparse coding represents a signal by a linear combination of only a few atoms of a learned over-complete dictionary. While sparse coding exhibits compelling performance for various machine learning tasks, the process of obtaining sparse code with fixed dictionary is independent for each data point without considering the geometric information and manifold structure of the entire data. We propose Support Regularized Sparse Coding (SRSC) which produces sparse codes that account for the manifold structure of the data by encouraging nearby data in the manifold to choose similar dictionary atoms. In this way, the obtained support regularized sparse codes capture the locally linear structure of the data manifold and enjoy robustness to data noise. We present the optimization algorithm of SRSC with theoretical guarantee for the optimization over the sparse codes. We also propose a feed-forward neural network termed Deep Support Regularized Sparse Coding (Deep-SRSC) as a fast encoder to approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRSC and Deep-SRSC."
Tying Word Vectors and Word Classifiers: A Loss Framework for Language Modeling,"Recurrent neural networks have been very successful at predicting sequences of words in tasks such as language modeling. However, all such models are based on the conventional classification framework, where model is trained against one-hot targets, and each word is represented both as an input and as an output in isolation. This causes inefficiencies in learning both in terms of utilizing all of the information and in terms of the number of parameters needed to train. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that facilitates better learning in language modeling, and show that our framework leads to tying together the input embedding and the output projection matrices, greatly reducing the number of trainable variables. Our LSTM model lowers the state of the art word-level perplexity on the Penn Treebank to 68.5.

Efficient Calculation of Polynomial Features on Sparse Matrices,"We provide an algorithm for polynomial feature expansion that both operates on
and produces a compressed sparse row matrix without any densification. For a
vector of dimension D, density d, and degree k the algorithm has time complexity
O(d^k * D^k) where k is the polynomial-feature order; this is an improvement by a factor d^k
over the standard method."
"ParMAC: distributed optimisation of nested functions, with application to binary autoencoders","Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition of multiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvex objective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such ""nested"" functions is the ""method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC)"". MAC introduces an auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with nondifferentiable layers. We describe ParMAC, a distributed-computation model for MAC. This trains on a dataset distributed across machines while limiting the amount of communication so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. ParMAC works on a cluster of machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines. ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing. We study the convergence of ParMAC and its parallel speedup, and implement ParMAC using MPI to learn binary autoencoders for fast image retrieval, achieving nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster with a training set of 100 million high-dimensional points.

Chess Game Concepts Emerge under Weak Supervision: A Case Study of Tic-tac-toe,"This paper explores the possibility of learning chess game concepts under weak supervision with convolutional neural networks, which is a topic that has not been visited to the best of our knowledge. We put this task in three different backgrounds: (1) deep reinforcement learning has shown an amazing capability to learn a mapping from visual inputs to most rewarding actions, without knowing the concepts of a video game. But how could we confirm that the network understands these concepts or it just does not? (2) cross-modal supervision for visual representation learning draws much attention recently. Is this methodology still applicable when it comes to the domain of game concepts and actions? (3) class activation mapping is widely recognized as a visualization technique to help us understand what a network has learnt. Is it possible for it to activate at non-salient regions? With the simplest chess game tic-tac-toe, we report interesting results as answers to those three questions mentioned above. All codes, pre-processed datasets and pre-trained models will be released."
Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation allows changing the agent's goal at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.

On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks,"We study the expressive power of deep neural networks before and after
training. Considering neural nets after random initialization, we show that
three natural measures of expressivity all display an exponential dependence
on the depth of the network. We prove, theoretically and experimentally,
that all of these measures are in fact related to a fourth quantity, trajectory
length. This quantity grows exponentially in the depth of the network, and
is responsible for the depth sensitivity observed. These results translate
to consequences for networks during and after training. They suggest that
parameters earlier in a network have greater influence on its expressive power
– in particular, given a layer, its influence on expressivity is determined by
the remaining depth of the network after that layer. This is verified with
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also explore the effect of training
on the input-output map, and find that it trades off between the stability
and expressivity of the input-output map."
Universality in halting time,"The authors present empirical distributions for the halting time (measured by the number of iterations to reach a given accuracy) of optimization algorithms applied to two random systems: spin glasses and deep learning. Given an algorithm, which we take to be both the optimization routine and the form of the random landscape, the fluctuations of the halting time follow a distribution that remains unchanged even when the input is changed drastically. We observe two main classes, a Gumbel-like distribution that appears in Google searches, human decision times, QR factorization and spin glasses, and a Gaussian-like distribution that appears in conjugate gradient method, deep network with MNIST input data and deep network with random input data. This empirical evidence suggests presence of a class of distributions for which the halting time is independent of the underlying distribution under some conditions."
Learning Identity Mappings with Residual Gates,"We propose a technique to augment network layers by adding a linear gating mechanism, which provides a way to learn identity mappings by optimizing only one parameter. We also introduce a new metric which served as basis for the technique. It captures the difficulty involved in learning identity mappings for different types of network models, and provides a new theoretical intuition for the increased depths of models such as Highway and Residual Networks. We propose a new model, the Gated Residual Network, which is the result when augmenting Residual Networks. Experimental results show that augmenting layers grants increased performance, less issues with depth, and more layer independence -- fully removing them does not cripple the model. We evaluate our method on MNIST using fully-connected networks and on CIFAR-10 using Wide ResNets, achieving a relative error reduction of more than 8% in the latter when compared to the original model."
Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent with Sound Combiners,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a well-known method for regression and classification tasks. However, it is an inherently sequential algorithm — at each step, the processing of the current example depends on the parameters learned from the previous examples. Prior approaches to parallelizing SGD, such as Hogwild! and AllReduce, do not honor these dependences across threads and thus can potentially suffer poor convergence rates and/or poor scalability. This paper proposes SymSGD, a parallel SGD algorithm that retains the sequential semantics of SGD in expectation. Each thread in this approach learns a local model and a probabilistic model combiner that allows the local models to be combined to produce the same result as what a sequential SGD would have produced, in expectation. This SymSGD approach is applicable to any linear learner whose update rule is linear. This paper evaluates SymSGD’s accuracy and performance on 9 datasets on a shared-memory machine shows up-to 13× speedup over our heavily optimized sequential baseline on 16 cores."
Towards Deep Interpretability (MUS-ROVER II): Learning Hierarchical Representations of Tonal Music,"Music theory studies the regularity of patterns in music to capture concepts underlying music styles and composers' decisions. This paper continues the study of building \emph{automatic theorists} (rovers) to learn and represent music concepts that lead to human interpretable knowledge and further lead to materials for educating people. Our previous work took a first step in algorithmic concept learning of tonal music, studying high-level representations (concepts) of symbolic music (scores) and extracting interpretable rules for composition. This paper further studies the representation \emph{hierarchy} through the learning process, and supports \emph{adaptive} memory selection in the resulting language model. This leads to a deeper-level interpretability that expands from individual rules to a dynamic system of rules, making the entire rule learning process more cognitive. The outcome is a new rover, MUS-ROVER \RN{2}, trained on Bach's chorales, which outputs customizable syllabi for learning compositional rules. We demonstrate comparable results to our music pedagogy, while also presenting the differences and variations. In addition, we point out the rover's potential usages in style recognition and synthesis, as well as applications beyond music."
Divide and Conquer with Neural Networks,"We consider the learning of algorithmic tasks by mere observation of input-output pairs. 
Rather than studying this as a black-box discrete regression problem with no assumption whatsoever 
on the input-output mapping, we concentrate on tasks that are amenable to the principle of divide and conquer, and study what are its implications in terms of learning. 

This principle creates a powerful inductive bias that we exploit with neural architectures that are defined recursively, by learning two scale-invariant atomic operators: how to split a given input into two disjoint sets, and how to merge two partially solved tasks into a larger partial solution. The scale invariance creates parameter sharing across all stages of the architecture, and the dynamic design creates architectures whose complexity can be tuned in a differentiable manner.

As a result, our model is trained by backpropagation not only to minimize the errors at the output, but also to do so as efficiently as possible, by enforcing shallower computation graphs. Moreover, thanks to the scale invariance, the model can be trained only with only input/output pairs, removing the need to know oracle intermediate split and merge decisions. As it turns out, accuracy and complexity are not independent qualities, and we verify empirically that when the learnt complexity matches the underlying complexity of the task, this results in higher accuracy and better generalization in two paradigmatic problems: sorting and finding planar convex hulls."
Modular Multitask Reinforcement Learning with Policy Sketches,"We describe a framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning guided by
policy sketches. Sketches annotate each task with a sequence of named subtasks,
providing high-level structural relationships among tasks, but not providing the
detailed guidance required by previous work on learning policy abstractions for
RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations).
Our approach associates every subtask with its own modular subpolicy,
and jointly optimizes over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across
shared subpolicies. This optimization is accomplished via a simple decoupled
actor–critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from
dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
maze navigation game and a 2-D Minecraft-inspired crafting game. Both games
feature extremely sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a
number of high-level subgoals (e.g. escaping from a sequence of locked rooms or
collecting and combining various ingredients in the proper order). Experiments
illustrate two main advantages of our approach. First, we outperform standard
baselines that learn task-specific or shared monolithic policies. Second, our
method naturally induces a library of primitive behaviors that can be recombined
to rapidly acquire policies for new tasks."
Gradients of Counterfactuals,"Gradients have been used to quantify feature importance in machine learning models. Unfortunately, in nonlinear deep networks, not only individual neurons but also the whole network can saturate, and as a result an important input feature can have a tiny gradient. We study various networks, and observe that this phenomena is indeed widespread, across many inputs.

We propose to examine interior gradients, which are gradients of counterfactual inputs constructed by scaling down the original input. We apply our method to the GoogleNet architecture for object recognition in images, as well as a ligand-based virtual screening network with categorical features and an LSTM based language model for the Penn Treebank dataset. We visualize how interior gradients better capture feature importance. Furthermore, interior gradients are applicable to a wide variety of deep networks, and have the attribution property that the feature importance scores sum to the the prediction score. 

Best of all, interior gradients can be computed just as easily as gradients. In contrast, previous methods are complex to implement, which hinders practical adoption."
Development of JavaScript-based deep learning platform and application to distributed training,"Deep learning is increasingly attracting attention for processing big data.
Existing frameworks for deep learning must be set up to specialized computer systems. Gaining sufficient computing resources therefore entails high costs of deployment and maintenance.
In this work, we implement a matrix library and deep learning framework that uses JavaScript. It can run on web browsers operating on ordinary personal computers and smartphones.
Using JavaScript, deep learning can be accomplished in widely diverse environments without the necessity for software installation. Using GPGPU from WebCL framework, our framework can train large scale convolutional neural networks such as VGGNet and ResNet.
In the experiments, we demonstrate their practicality by training VGGNet in a distributed manner using web browsers as the client.

A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation,"The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence.
In this paper we present a faster and simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. 
This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies.
On WMT'16 English-Romanian translation we achieve competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art and we outperform several recently published results on the WMT'15 English-German task. 
Our models obtain almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation.
Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline. "
Discrete Variational Autoencoders,"Probabilistic models with discrete latent variables naturally capture datasets composed of discrete classes. However, they are difficult to train efficiently, since backpropagation through discrete variables is generally not possible. We present a novel method to train a class of probabilistic models with discrete latent variables using the variational autoencoder framework, including backpropagation through the discrete latent variables. The associated class of probabilistic models comprises an undirected discrete component and a directed hierarchical continuous component. The discrete component captures the distribution over the disconnected smooth manifolds induced by the continuous component. As a result, this class of models efficiently learns both the class of objects in an image, and their specific realization in pixels, from unsupervised data; and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the permutation-invariant MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes datasets."
Do Deep Convolutional Nets Really Need to be Deep and Convolutional?,"Yes, they do.  This paper provides the first empirical demonstration that deep convolutional models really need to be both deep and convolutional, even when trained with methods such as distillation that allow small or shallow models of high accuracy to be trained.  Although previous research showed that shallow feed-forward nets sometimes can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep
nets while using the same number of parameters as the deep models they mimic, in this paper we demonstrate that the same methods cannot be used to train accurate models on CIFAR-10 unless the student models contain multiple layers of convolution.  Although the student models do not have to be as deep as the teacher model they mimic, the students need multiple convolutional layers to learn functions of comparable accuracy as the deep convolutional teacher.  "
Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design Patterns,"Recent research in the deep learning field has produced a plethora of new architectures.  At the same time, a growing number of groups are applying deep learning to new applications.  Some of these groups are likely to be composed of inexperienced deep learning practitioners who are baffled by the dizzying array of architecture choices and therefore opt to use an older architecture (i.e., Alexnet).  Here we attempt to bridge this gap by mining the collective knowledge contained in recent deep learning research to discover underlying principles for designing neural network architectures.  In addition, we describe several architectural innovations, including Fractal of FractalNet network, Stagewise Boosting Networks, and Taylor Series Networks (our Caffe code and prototxt files are available at https://github.com/iPhysicist/CNNDesignPatterns). We hope others are inspired to build on our preliminary work.

An Analysis of Feature Regularization for Low-shot Learning,"Low-shot visual learning, the ability to recognize novel object categories from very few, or even one example, is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Though successful on many tasks, deep learning approaches tends to be notoriously data-hungry. Recently, feature penalty regularization has been proved effective on capturing new concepts. In this work, we provide both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis on how and why these methods work. We also propose a better design of cost function with improved performance. Close scrutiny reveals the centering effect of feature representation, as well as the intrinsic connection with batch normalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, the one-shot learning benchmark “Omniglot”, and large-scale ImageNet validate our analysis."
Geometry of Polysemy,"Vector representations of words have heralded a transformational approach to classical problems in NLP; the most popular example is word2vec. However, a single vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many (frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings.    In this paper, we propose a three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context representations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a word and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding that  a sentence containing a target word is  well represented by a low-rank subspace,  instead of a point in a vector  space. We then show that the subspaces associated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a line (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a  clustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the representations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans, leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the corpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several prototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to intuit and justify  the various geometric representations,  we validate our algorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present new state-of-the-art results."
Learning Invariant Representations Of Planar Curves ,"We propose a metric learning framework for the construction of invariant geometric
functions of planar curves for the Euclidean and Similarity group of transformations.
We leverage on the representational power of convolutional neural
networks to compute these geometric quantities. In comparison with axiomatic
constructions, we show that the invariants approximated by the learning architectures
have better numerical qualities such as robustness to noise, resiliency to
sampling, as well as the ability to adapt to occlusion and partiality. Finally, we develop
a novel multi-scale representation in a similarity metric learning paradigm."
Combating Deep Reinforcement Learning's Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear,"To use deep reinforcement learning in the wild, we might hope for an agent that would never make catastrophic mistakes. At the very least, we could hope that an agent would eventually learn to avoid old mistakes. Unfortunately, even in simple environments, modern deep reinforcement learning techniques are doomed by a Sisyphean curse. Owing to the use of function approximation, these agents eventually forget experiences as they become exceedingly unlikely under a new policy. Consequently, for as long as they continue to train, state-aggregating agents may periodically relive catastrophic mistakes. We demonstrate unacceptable performance of deep Q-networks on two toy problems. We then introduce intrinsic fear, a method that mitigates these problems by avoiding dangerous states. "
Reasoning with Memory Augmented Neural Networks for Language Comprehension,"Hypothesis testing is an important cognitive process that supports human reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a computational hypothesis testing approach based on memory augmented neural networks. Our approach involves a hypothesis testing loop that reconsiders and progressively refines a previously formed hypothesis in order to generate new hypotheses to test. We apply the proposed approach to language comprehension task by using Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE). Our NSE models achieve the state-of-the-art results showing an absolute improvement of 1.2% to 2.6% accuracy over previous results obtained by single and ensemble systems on standard machine comprehension benchmarks such as the Children's Book Test (CBT) and Who-Did-What (WDW) news article datasets."
Learning recurrent representations for hierarchical behavior modeling,"We propose a framework for detecting action patterns from motion sequences and modeling the sensory-motor relationship of animals, using a generative recurrent neural network. The network has a discriminative part (classifying actions) and a generative part (predicting motion), whose recurrent cells are laterally connected, allowing higher levels of the network to represent high level behavioral phenomena. We test our framework on two types of data, fruit fly behavior and online handwriting. Our results show that 1) taking advantage of unlabeled sequences, by predicting future motion, significantly improves action detection performance when training labels are scarce, 2) the network learns to represent high level phenomena such as writer identity and fly gender, without supervision, and 3) simulated motion trajectories, generated by treating motion prediction as input to the network, look realistic and may be used to qualitatively evaluate whether the model has learnt generative control rules."
Deep Unsupervised Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders,"We study a variant of the variational autoencoder model with a Gaussian mixture as a prior distribution, with the goal of performing unsupervised clustering through deep generative models. We observe that the standard variational approach in these models is unsuited for unsupervised clustering, and mitigate this problem by leveraging a principled information-theoretic regularisation term known as consistency violation. Adding this term to the standard variational optimisation objective yields networks with both meaningful internal representations and well-defined clusters. We demonstrate the performance of this scheme on synthetic data, MNIST and SVHN, showing that the obtained clusters are distinct, interpretable and result in achieving higher performance on unsupervised clustering classification than previous approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Nat-D/GMVAE."
Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale,"Adversarial examples are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models.
They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black
box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters.
Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial
examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error
on clean inputs.
So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems.
In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet.
Our contributions include:
(1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets,
(2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods,
(3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack
      methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks,
      and
(4) resolution of a ``label leaking'' effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform
      better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial
      example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to
      exploit regularities in the construction process.

A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics,"One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers. Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose an implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software."
Improved Architectures for Computer Go,AlphaGo trains policy networks with both supervised and reinforcement learning and makes different policy networks play millions of games so as to train a value network. The reinforcement learning part requires massive ammount of computation. We propose to train networks for computer Go so that given accuracy is reached with much less examples. We modify the architecture of the networks in order to train them faster and to have better accuracy in the end.
Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,"To enhance developer productivity, all modern integrated development environments (IDEs) include code suggestion functionality that proposes likely next tokens at the cursor. While current IDEs work well for statically-typed languages, their reliance on type annotations means that they do not provide the same level of support for dynamic programming languages as for statically-typed languages. Moreover, suggestion engines in modern IDEs do not propose expressions or multi-statement idiomatic code. Recent work has shown that language models can improve code suggestion systems by learning from software repositories. This paper introduces a neural language model with a sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long range dependencies. We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past."
Demystifying ResNet,"We provide a theoretical explanation for the superb performance of ResNet via the study of deep linear networks and some nonlinear variants. We show that with or without nonlinearities, by adding shortcuts that have depth two, the condition number of the Hessian of the loss function at the zero initial point is depth-invariant, which makes training very deep models no more difficult than shallow ones. Shortcuts of higher depth result in an extremely flat (high-order) stationary point initially, from which the optimization algorithm is hard to escape. The 1-shortcut, however, is essentially equivalent to no shortcuts. Extensive experiments are provided accompanying our theoretical results. We show that initializing the network to small weights with 2-shortcuts achieves significantly better results than random Gaussian (Xavier) initialization, orthogonal initialization, and shortcuts of deeper depth, from various perspectives ranging from final loss, learning dynamics and stability, to the behavior of the Hessian along the learning process."
Learning similarity preserving representations with neural similarity and context encoders,"We introduce similarity encoders (SimEc), which learn similarity preserving representations by using a feed-forward neural network to map data into an embedding space where the original similarities can be approximated linearly. The model can easily compute representations for novel (out-of-sample) data points, even if the original pairwise similarities of the training set were generated by an unknown process such as human ratings. This is demonstrated by creating embeddings of both image and text data.
Furthermore, the idea behind similarity encoders gives an intuitive explanation of the optimization strategy used by the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) word2vec model trained with negative sampling. Based on this insight, we define context encoders (ConEc), which can improve the word embeddings created with word2vec by using the local context of words to create out-of-vocabulary embeddings and representations for words with multiple meanings. The benefit of this is illustrated by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task."
Predicting Medications from Diagnostic Codes with Recurrent Neural Networks,"It is a surprising fact that electronic medical records are failing at one of their primary purposes, that of tracking the set of medications that the patient is actively taking. Studies estimate that up to 50% of such lists omit active drugs, and that up to 25% of all active medications do not appear on the appropriate patient list. Manual efforts to maintain these lists involve a great deal of tedious human labor, which could be reduced by computational tools to suggest likely missing or incorrect medications on a patient’s list. We report here an application of recurrent neural networks to predict the likely therapeutic classes of medications that a patient is taking, given a sequence of the last 100 billing codes in their record. Our best model was a GRU that achieved high prediction accuracy (micro-averaged AUC 0.93, Label Ranking Loss 0.076), limited by hardware constraints on model size. Additionally, examining individual cases revealed that many of the predictions marked incorrect were likely to be examples of either omitted medications or omitted billing codes, supporting our assertion of a substantial number of errors and omissions in the data, and the likelihood of models such as these to help correct them."
Recurrent Mixture Density Network for Spatiotemporal Visual Attention,"In many computer vision tasks, the relevant information to solve the problem at hand is mixed to irrelevant, distracting information. This has motivated researchers to design attentional models that can dynamically focus on parts of images or videos that are salient, e.g., by down-weighting irrelevant pixels. In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal attentional model that learns where to look in a video directly from human fixation data. We model visual attention with a mixture of Gaussians at each frame. This distribution is used to express the probability of saliency for each pixel. Time consistency in videos is modeled hierarchically by: 1) deep 3D convolutional features to represent spatial and short-term time relations and 2) a long short-term memory network on top that aggregates the clip-level representation of sequential clips and therefore expands the temporal domain from few frames to seconds. The parameters of the proposed model are optimized via maximum likelihood estimation using human fixations as training data, without knowledge of the action in each video. Our experiments on Hollywood2 show state-of-the-art performance on saliency prediction for video. We also show that  our attentional model trained on Hollywood2 generalizes well to UCF101 and it can be leveraged to improve action classification accuracy on both datasets."
Sentence Ordering using Recurrent Neural Networks,"Modeling the structure of coherent texts is a task of great importance in NLP. The task of organizing a given set of sentences into a coherent order has been
commonly used to build and evaluate models that understand such structure. In this work we propose an end-to-end neural approach based on the recently proposed
set to sequence mapping framework to address the sentence ordering problem. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the order discrimination task
on two datasets widely used in the literature. We also consider a new interesting task of ordering abstracts from conference papers and research proposals and
demonstrate strong performance against recent methods. Visualizing the sentence representations learned by the model shows that the model has captured high
level logical structure in these paragraphs. The model also learns rich semantic sentence representations by learning to order texts, performing comparably to
recent unsupervised representation learning methods in the sentence similarity and paraphrase detection tasks."
Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry,"Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input. We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well. Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation under favored partitions of the input."
Knowledge Adaptation: Teaching to Adapt,"Domain adaptation is crucial in many real-world applications where the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data. Previous Deep Learning-based approaches to domain adaptation need to be trained jointly on source and target domain data and are therefore unappealing in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or where a domain is evolving, e.g. spam detection where attackers continuously change their tactics.

To fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario. We show how a student model achieves state-of-the-art results on unsupervised domain adaptation from multiple sources on a standard sentiment analysis benchmark by taking into account the domain-specific expertise of multiple teachers and the similarities between their domains.

When learning from a single teacher, using domain similarity to gauge trustworthiness is inadequate. To this end, we propose a simple metric that correlates well with the teacher's accuracy in the target domain. We demonstrate that incorporating high-confidence examples selected by this metric enables the student model to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the single-source scenario."
Enforcing constraints on outputs with unconstrained inference,"  Increasingly, practitioners apply neural networks to complex
  problems in natural language processing (NLP), such as syntactic
  parsing, that have rich output structures. Many such applications
  require deterministic constraints on the output values; for example,
  requiring that the sequential outputs encode a valid tree. While
  hidden units might capture such properties, the network is not
  always able to learn them from the training data alone, and
  practitioners must then resort to post-processing. In this paper, we
  present an inference method for neural networks that enforces
  deterministic constraints on outputs without performing
  post-processing or expensive discrete search over the feasible
  space. Instead, for each input, we nudge the continuous weights
  until the network's unconstrained inference procedure generates an
  output that satisfies the constraints. We find that our method
  reduces the number of violating outputs by up to 81\%, while
  improving accuracy."
Hierarchical compositional feature learning,"We introduce the hierarchical compositional network (HCN), a directed generative model able to discover and disentangle, without supervision, the building blocks of a set of binary images. The building blocks are binary features defined hierarchically as a composition of some of the features in the layer immediately below, arranged in a particular manner. At a high level, HCN is similar to a sigmoid belief network with pooling. Inference and learning in HCN are very challenging and existing variational approximations do not work satisfactorily. A main contribution of this work is to show that both can be addressed using max-product message passing (MPMP) with a particular schedule (no EM required). Also, using MPMP as an inference engine for HCN makes new tasks simple: adding supervision information, classifying images, or performing inpainting all correspond to clamping some variables of the model to their known values and running MPMP on the rest. When used for classification, fast inference with HCN has exactly the same functional form as a convolutional neural network (CNN) with linear activations and binary weights. However, HCN’s features are qualitatively very different."
Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language,"Static analyzers are meta-programs that analyze programs to detect
  potential errors or collect information. For example, they are used
  as security tools to detect potential buffer overflows. Also, they
  are used by compilers to verify that a program is well-formed and
  collect information to generate better code. In this paper, we
  address the following question: can a static analyzer be learned
  from data? More specifically, can we use deep learning to learn a
  static analyzer without the need for complicated feature
  engineering? We show that long short-term memory networks are able
  to learn a basic static analyzer for a simple toy language. However,
  pre-existing approaches based on feature engineering, hidden Markov
  models, or basic recurrent neural networks fail on such a simple
  problem. Finally, we show how to make such a tool usable by
  employing a language model to help the programmer detect where the
  reported errors are located."
On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima,"The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data,  say $32$--$512$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a significant degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions---and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We also discuss several empirical strategies that might help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap, and conclude with a set of open questions.

Efficient Representation of Low-Dimensional Manifolds using Deep Networks,"We consider the ability of deep neural networks to represent data that lies near a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space.  We show that deep networks can efficiently extract the intrinsic, low-dimensional coordinates of such data.  Specifically we show that the first two layers of a deep network can exactly embed points lying on a monotonic chain, a special type of piecewise linear manifold, mapping them to a low-dimensional Euclidean space.  Remarkably, the network can do this using an almost optimal number of parameters. We also show that this network projects nearby points onto the manifold and then embeds them with little error. Experiments demonstrate that training with stochastic gradient descent can indeed find efficient representations similar to the one presented in this paper."
Filling in the details: Perceiving from low fidelity visual input,"Humans perceive their surroundings in great detail even though most of our visual field is reduced to low-fidelity color-deprived (e.g., dichromatic) input by the retina. In contrast, most deep learning architectures deploy computational resources homogeneously to every part of the visual input. Is such a prodigal deployment of resources necessary? In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the extent to which connectionist architectures can perceive an image in full detail even when presented with low acuity, distorted input. Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information. We find that networks can compensate for low acuity input by learning global feature functions that allow the network to fill in some of the missing details. For example, the networks accurately perceive shape and color in the periphery, even when 75\% of the input is achromatic and low resolution. On the other hand, the network is prone to similar mistakes as humans; for example, when presented with a fully grayscale landscape image, it perceives the sky as blue when the sky is actually a red sunset. "
Modelling Relational Time Series using Gaussian Embeddings,"We address the problem of modeling multiple simultaneous time series where the observations are correlated not only inside each series, but among the different series. This problem happens in many domains such as ecology, meteorology, etc.  We propose a new dynamical state space model, based on representation learning, for modeling the evolution of such series. The joint relational and temporal dynamics of the series are modeled as Gaussian distributions in a latent space. A decoder maps the latent representations to the observations. The two components (dynamic model and decoder) are jointly trained. Using stochastic representations allows us to model the uncertainty inherent to observations and to predict unobserved values together with a confidence in the prediction."
Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks,We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.
Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks,"Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks."
Compact Embedding of Binary-coded Inputs and Outputs using Bloom Filters,"The size of neural network models that deal with sparse inputs and outputs is often dominated by the dimensionality of those inputs and outputs. Large models with high-dimensional inputs and outputs are difficult to train due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4 alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as 'on-the-fly' constant-time operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or training configuration."
A Deep Learning Approach for Joint Video Frame and Reward Prediction in Atari Games,"Reinforcement learning is concerned with learning to interact with environments that are initially unknown. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches, such as DQN, are model-free and learn to act effectively across a wide range of environments such as Atari games, but require huge amounts of data. Model-based techniques are more data-efficient, but need to acquire explicit knowledge about the environment dynamics or the reward structure. 

In this paper we take a step towards using model-based techniques in environments with high-dimensional visual state space when system dynamics and the reward structure are both unknown and need to be learned, by demonstrating that it is possible to learn both jointly.
Empirical evaluation on five Atari games demonstrate accurate cumulative reward prediction of up to 200 frames. We consider these positive results as opening up important directions for model-based RL in complex, initially unknown environments."
Compositional Kernel Machines,"Convolutional neural networks (convnets) have achieved impressive results on recent computer vision benchmarks. While they benefit from multiple layers that encode nonlinear decision boundaries and a degree of translation invariance, training convnets is a lengthy procedure fraught with local optima.  Alternatively, a kernel method that incorporates the compositionality and symmetry of convnets could learn similar nonlinear concepts yet with easier training and architecture selection.  We propose compositional kernel machines (CKMs), which effectively create an exponential number of virtual training instances by composing transformed sub-regions of the original ones.  Despite this, CKM discriminant functions can be computed efficiently using ideas from sum-product networks.  The ability to compose virtual instances in this way gives CKMs invariance to translations and other symmetries, and combats the curse of dimensionality.  Just as support vector machines (SVMs) eclipsed multilayer perceptrons in the 1990s, CKMs could become a compelling alternative to convnets with reduced training time and sample complexity.  In this paper we define CKMs, explore their properties, and present promising results on NORB datasets.  Experiments show that CKMs are superior to standard instance-based methods and can learn symmetries and compositional concepts from fewer samples without data augmentation."
Pedestrian Detection Based On Fast R-CNN and Batch Normalization ,"Most of the pedestrian detection methods are based on hand-crafted features which produce low accuracy on complex scenes. With the development of deep learning method, pedestrian detection has achieved great success. In this paper, we take advantage of a convolutional neural network which is based on Fast R-CNN framework to extract robust pedestrian features for efficient and effective pedestrian detection in complicated environments. We use the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate effective region proposals from an image, as the quality of extracted region proposals can greatly affect the detection performance. In order to reduce the training time and to improve the generalization performance, we add a batch normalization layer between the convolutional layer and the activation function layer. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance on the INRIA and ETH datasets."
An Actor-critic Algorithm for Learning Rate Learning,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which updates the model parameters by adding a local gradient times a learning rate at each step, is widely used in model training of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks. It is observed that the models trained by SGD are sensitive to learning rates and good learning rates are problem specific. To avoid manually searching of learning rates, which is tedious and inefficient, we propose an algorithm to automatically learn learning rates using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we train a policy network called actor to decide the learning rate at each step during training, and a value network called critic to give feedback about quality of the decision (e.g., the goodness of the learning rate outputted by the actor) that the actor made. Experiments show that our method leads to good convergence of SGD and can prevent overfitting to a certain extent, resulting in better performance than human-designed competitors."
Adversarial Training Methods for Semi-Supervised Text Classification,"Adversarial training provides a means of regularizing supervised learning algorithms while virtual adversarial training is able to extend supervised learning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting.
However, both methods require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector, which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word representations.
We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent neural network rather than to the original input itself.
The proposed method achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and purely supervised tasks.
We provide visualizations and analysis showing that the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training, the model is less prone to overfitting.

Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information,"Combining different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the same dataset as an ensemble is  commonly used  to improve performance of CNNs in many applications. However, such multi-model combination suffers from high computational cost and memory consumption. Moreover, when these different models share the same deep architecture, the performance boost brought by the ensemble becomes even marginal. In this paper, we claim that the performance boost from the ensemble can be seen as benefit of increasing feature variance. With this assumption, we consider training one single model in a way that can maximize its inherent diversity and thus enable the model to learn better feature representation with a stronger generalization ability. To this end, we propose a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) to learn features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way by exploiting privileged information for optimization, which automatically emphasizes feature diversity within a single model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, well demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN models."
Fine-grained Analysis of Sentence Embeddings Using Auxiliary Prediction Tasks,"There is a lot of research interest in encoding variable length sentences into fixed
length vectors, in a way that preserves the sentence meanings. Two common
methods include representations based on averaging word vectors, and representations based on the hidden states of recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs.
The sentence vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks
or for pre-training in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known
about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about
the language information they capture.
We propose a framework that facilitates better understanding of the encoded representations. We define prediction tasks around isolated aspects of sentence structure (namely sentence length, word content, and word order), and score representations by the ability to train a classifier to solve each prediction task when
using the representation as input. We demonstrate the potential contribution of the
approach by analyzing different sentence representation mechanisms. The analysis sheds light on the relative strengths of different sentence embedding methods with respect to these low level prediction tasks, and on the effect of the encoded
vector’s dimensionality on the resulting representations."
Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models,Recent neural network sequence models with softmax classifiers have achieved their best language modeling performance only with very large hidden states and large vocabularies. Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity) while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with more realistic vocabularies and corpora we also introduce the freely available WikiText corpus.
Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction,We propose a novel attention model which can accurately attend to target objects of various scales and shapes in images. The model is trained to gradually suppress irrelevant regions in an input image via a progressive attentive process over multiple layers of a convolutional neural network. The attentive process in each layer determines whether to pass or suppress features at certain spatial locations for use in the next layer. We further employ local contexts to estimate attention probability at each location since it is difficult to infer accurate attention by observing a feature vector from a single location only. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed attention network outperforms traditional attention methods in visual attribute prediction tasks.
A Neural Knowledge Language Model,"Current language models have significant limitations in their ability to encode and decode knowledge. This is mainly because they acquire knowledge based on statistical co-occurrences, even if most of the knowledge words are rarely observed named entities. In this paper, we propose a Neural Knowledge Language Model (NKLM) which combines symbolic knowledge provided by a knowledge graph with the RNN language model. At each time step, the model predicts a fact on which the observed word is to be based. Then, a word is either generated from the vocabulary or copied from the knowledge graph. We train and test the model on a new dataset, WikiFacts. In experiments, we show that the NKLM significantly improves the perplexity while generating a much smaller number of unknown words. In addition, we demonstrate that the sampled descriptions include named entities which were used to be the unknown words in RNN language models.
"
Fuzzy paraphrases in learning word representations with a corpus and a lexicon,"There is a not carefully addressed issue in the previous works using lexicons or ontologies to train or improve distributed word representations: For polysemous words and utterances changing meaning in different contexts, their paraphrases or related entities in a lexicon or an ontology are unreliable and sometimes deteriorate the learning of word representations. 
Thus, we propose an approach to address the problem. We consider each paraphrase of a word in a lexicon not fully a paraphrase, but a fuzzy member (fuzzy paraphrase) in the paraphrase set whose membership (i.e., degree of truth) depends on the contexts.
Then we propose an efficient method to use the fuzzy paraphrases to learn word embeddings. We approximately estimate the local membership of paraphrases, and train word embeddings using a lexicon jointly by replacing the words in the contexts with their paraphrases randomly subjected to the membership of each paraphrase. 
The experimental results show that our method is efficient, overcomes the weakness of the previous related works in extracting semantic information and outperforms the previous works of learning word representations using lexicons."
What Is the Best Practice for CNNs Applied to Visual Instance Retrieval?,"Previous work has shown that feature maps of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
can be interpreted as feature representation of a particular image region. Features aggregated from
these feature maps have been exploited for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in
recent years. The key to the success of such methods is the feature representation. However, the different
factors that impact the effectiveness of features are still not explored thoroughly. There are much less
discussion about the best combination of them.

The main contribution of our paper is the thorough evaluations of the various factors that affect the
discriminative ability of the features extracted from CNNs. Based on the evaluation results, we also identify 
the best choices for different factors and propose a new multi-scale image feature representation method to 
encode the image effectively. Finally, we show that the proposed method generalises well and outperforms 
the state-of-the-art methods on four typical datasets used for visual instance retrieval."
Learning Deep ANOVA Networks,"We propose a novel deep generative model: the deep ANOVA networks. This
model generalizes deep belief networks by allowing fully nonparametric interactions
between layers of variables and allowing both continuous and discrete hidden
variables. We train the network by a greedy layer-wise training algorithm based
on the restricted ANOVA machines, which are developed from the structured latent
log-density ANOVA model. We apply the score matching method to learn
the restricted ANOVA machines in each layer. Our algorithm can efficiently estimate
the gradient of the score matching loss even if its explicit form is intractable.
The statistical rate of the excess risk of our score matching estimator is shown to
be optimal. Based on the deep ANOVA networks, we also develop a functional
extension of neural networks with adaptive activation functions and filters. Experiments
of the image denoising and classification on the MNIST dataset show the
advantage of both the restricted ANOVA machines and deep ANOVA networks as
generative models."
Rectified Factor Networks for Biclustering,"Biclustering is evolving into one of the major tools for analyzing large datasets given as matrix of samples times features. Biclustering has several noteworthy applications and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively.

FABIA is one of the most successful biclustering methods and is used by companies like Bayer, Janssen, or Zalando. FABIA is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, FABIA is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufficiently decorrelated. Sample membership is difficult to determine because vectors do not have exact zero entries and can have both large positive and large negative values.

We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. RFNs efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.

On 400 benchmark datasets with artificially implanted biclusters, RFN significantly outperformed 13 other biclustering competitors including FABIA. In biclustering experiments on three gene expression datasets with known clusters that were determined by separate measurements, RFN biclustering was two times significantly better than the other 13 methods and once on second place. On data of the 1000 Genomes Project, RFN could identify DNA segments which indicate, that interbreeding with other hominins starting already before ancestors of modern humans left Africa."
Sampling Generative Networks: Notes on a Few Effective Techniques,We introduce several techniques for sampling and visualizing the latent spaces of generative models. Replacing linear interpolation with spherical linear interpolation prevents diverging from a model's prior distribution and produces sharper samples. J-Diagrams and MINE grids are introduced as visualizations of manifolds created by analogies and nearest neighbors. We demonstrate two new techniques for deriving attribute vectors: bias-corrected vectors with data replication and synthetic vectors with data augmentation. Most techniques are intended to be independent of model type and examples are shown on both Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.
Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?,"The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance. We compare the impact of four different action parameterizations (torques, muscle-activations, target joint angles, and target joint-angle velocities) in terms of learning time, policy robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates. Our results are evaluated on a gait cycle imitation task for multiple planar articulated figures and multiple gaits. We demonstrate that the local feedback provided by higher-level action parameterizations can significantly impact the learning, robustness, and quality of the resulting policies."
Extrapolation and learning equations,"In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a
suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and  outputs.
In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and  generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.
"
Iterative Refinement for Machine Translation,"Existing machine translation decoding algorithms generate translations in a strictly monotonic fashion and never revisit previous decisions. As a result, earlier mistakes cannot be corrected at a later stage. In this paper, we present a translation scheme that starts from an initial guess and then makes iterative improvements that may revisit previous decisions. We parameterize our model as a convolutional neural network that predicts discrete substitutions to an existing translation based on an attention mechanism over both the source sentence as well as the current translation output. By making less than one modification per sentence, we improve the output of a phrase-based translation system by up to 0.4 BLEU on WMT15 German-English translation."
An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction,"We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling. "
Understanding Neural Sparse Coding with Matrix Factorization,"Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in \cite{Gregor10}, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.

In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails."
Tighter bounds lead to improved classifiers,"The standard approach to supervised classification involves the minimization of a log-loss as an upper bound to the classification error. While this is a tight bound early on in the optimization, it overemphasizes the influence of incorrectly classified examples far from the decision boundary. Updating the upper bound during the optimization leads to improved classification rates while transforming the learning into a sequence of minimization problems. In addition, in the context where the classifier is part of a larger system, this modification makes it possible to link the performance of the classifier to that of the whole system, allowing the seamless introduction of external constraints."
Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,"Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such
as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may
inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis
of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.

To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to
providing strong privacy guarantees for training data. The approach combines, in
a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as
records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive
data, these models are not published, but instead used as ``teachers'' for a
``student'' model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting
among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or
the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be
understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset
dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.
 These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but
also inspect its internal workings.

Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how
teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like
DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN
thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning."
Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning,"Latent representation learned from multi-layered neural networks via hierarchical feature abstraction enables recent success of deep learning. Under the deep learning framework, generalization performance highly depends on the learned latent representation which is obtained from an appropriate training scenario with a task-specific objective on a designed network model. In this work, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent representation. We designed a neural network model based on the assumption that good base representation can be attained by maximizing the total correlation between the input, latent, and output variables. From the base model, we introduce a semantic noise modeling method which enables class-conditional perturbation on latent space to enhance the representational power of learned latent feature. During training, latent vector representation can be stochastically perturbed by a modeled class-conditional additive noise while maintaining its original semantic feature. It implicitly brings the effect of semantic augmentation on the latent space. The proposed model can be easily learned by back-propagation with common gradient-based optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method helps to achieve performance benefits against various previous approaches. We also provide the empirical analyses for the proposed class-conditional perturbation process including t-SNE visualization."
Ternary Weight Decomposition and Binary Activation Encoding for Fast and Compact Neural Network,"This paper aims to reduce test-time computational load of a deep neural network. Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware.
In our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error. Our experiments also revealed that compressing convolutional layers can accelerate inference of the entire network in exchange of slight increase in error."
HolStep: A Machine Learning Dataset for Higher-order Logic Theorem Proving,"Large computer-understandable proofs consist of millions of intermediate
logical steps. The vast majority of such steps originate from manually
selected and manually guided heuristics applied to intermediate goals.
So far, machine learning has generally not been used to filter or
generate these steps. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset based on
Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, for the purpose of developing new
machine learning-based theorem-proving strategies. We make this dataset
publicly available under the BSD license. We propose various machine
learning tasks that can be performed on this dataset, and discuss their
significance for theorem proving. We also benchmark a set of simple baseline
machine learning models suited for the tasks (including convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks). The results of our
baseline models show the promise of applying machine learning to HOL
theorem proving.

Vocabulary Selection Strategies for Neural Machine Translation,Classical translation models constrain the space of possible outputs by selecting a subset of translation rules based on the input sentence. Recent work on improving the efficiency of neural translation models adopted a similar strategy by restricting the output vocabulary to a subset of likely candidates given the source. In this paper we experiment with context and embedding-based selection methods and extend previous work by examining speed and accuracy trade-offs in more detail. We show that decoding time on CPUs can be reduced by up to 90% and training time by 25% on the WMT15 English-German and WMT16 English-Romanian tasks at the same or only negligible change in accuracy. This brings the time to decode with a state of the art neural translation system to just over 140 words per seconds on a single CPU core for English-German.
Efficient Communications in Training Large Scale Neural Networks,"We consider the problem of how to reduce the cost of communication that is re- quired for the parallel training of a neural network. The state-of-the-art method, Bulk Synchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (BSP-SGD), requires a many collective communication operations, like broadcasts of parameters or reduc- tions for sub-gradient aggregations, which for large messages quickly dominates overall execution time and limits parallel scalability. To address this problem, we develop a new technique for collective operations, referred to as Linear Pipelining (LP). It is tuned to the message sizes that arise in BSP-SGD, and works effectively on multi-GPU systems. Theoretically, the cost of LP is invariant to P , where P is the number of GPUs, while the cost of more conventional Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) scales like O(log P ). LP also demonstrate up to 2x faster bandwidth than Bidirectional Exchange (BE) techniques that are widely adopted by current MPI implementations. We apply these collectives to BSP-SGD, showing that the proposed implementations reduce communication bottlenecks in practice while preserving the attractive convergence properties of BSP-SGD."
Dynamic Partition Models,"We present a new approach for learning compact and intuitive distributed representations with binary encoding. Rather than summing up expert votes as in products of experts, we employ for each variable the opinion of the most reliable expert. Data points are hence explained through a partitioning of the variables into expert supports. The partitions are dynamically adapted based on which experts are present. During the learning phase we adopt a smoother version of this model that uses separate mixtures for each data dimension. In our experiments we achieve accurate reconstructions of high-dimensional data points with at most a dozen experts."
Adversarial examples in the physical world,"Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples.
An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified
very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier
to misclassify it.
In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does
not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake.
Adversarial examples pose security concerns
because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no
access to the underlying model.
Up to now, all previous work has assumed a threat model in which the adversary can
feed data directly into the machine learning classifier.
This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world,
for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input.
This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable
to adversarial examples.
We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from a cell-phone camera
to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system.
We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly
even when perceived through the camera."
Learning Efficient Algorithms with Hierarchical Attentive Memory,"In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel memory architecture for neural networks called Hierarchical Attentive Memory (HAM).  It is based on a binary tree with leaves corresponding to memory cells. This allows HAM to perform memory access in O(log n) complexity, which is a significant improvement over the standard attention mechanism that requires O(n) operations, where n is the size of the memory.  

We show that an LSTM network augmented with HAM can learn algorithms for problems like merging, sorting or binary searching from pure input-output examples.  In particular, it learns to sort n numbers in time O(n log n) and generalizes well to input sequences much longer than the ones seen during the training.  We also show that HAM can be trained to act like classic data structures: a stack, a FIFO queue and a priority queue."
Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD,"Distributed training of deep learning models on large-scale training data is typically conducted with asynchronous stochastic optimization to maximize the rate of updates, at the cost of additional noise introduced from asynchrony. In contrast, the synchronous approach is often thought to be impractical due to idle time wasted on waiting for straggling workers. We revisit these conventional beliefs in this paper, and examine the weaknesses of both approaches. We demonstrate that a third approach, synchronous optimization with backup workers, can avoid asynchronous noise while mitigating for the worst stragglers. Our approach is empirically validated and shown to converge faster and to better test accuracies.

Why Deep Neural Networks for Function Approximation?,"Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on $\varepsilon$) require $\Omega(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with $1/\varepsilon$) require $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.

New Learning Approach By Genetic Algorithm In A Convolutional Neural Network For Pattern Recognition,"Nowadays, advances in electronic circuits have created a fresh interest in a model for machine learning, named artificial neural networks. Neural networks have rendered facts at supernatural faster than ever before. That`s why implementation of models in pattern and voice recognition based on the operation of mammals’ brain has become an interest of scientific society. On the basis of preceding idea the CNN networks are inspired by the vision system of mammal`s brain in pattern recognition. Thus, the CNNs will be expanded to build advanced artificial brain and robots. Although, almost all of the presented articles are based on the error backpropagation algorithm and calculation of derivations of error, our innovative proposal refers to engaging TICA filters and NSGA-II genetic algorithms to train the LeCun-5 CNN network. Consequently, genetic algorithm updates the weights of LeCun-5 CNN network similar to chromosome update. Thus, in our approach the weights of LeCun-5 are obtained in two stages. The first is pre-training and the second is fine-tuning. As a result, our approach impacts in learning task by relying on the NSGA-II genetic algorithm and the TICA filters to earn the weights of the LeCun-5."
Amortised MAP Inference for Image Super-resolution,"Image Super-resolution (SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem, where a large number of plausible high-resolution images can explain the same downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss.
However, the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Here we introduce new methods for \emph{amortised MAP inference} whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models. We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data, achieving particularly good results in photo-realistic texture SR."
PREDICTION OF POTENTIAL HUMAN INTENTION USING SUPERVISED COMPETITIVE LEARNING,"We propose a learning method to quantify human intention. Generally, a human being will imagine several potential actions for a given scene, but only one of these actions will subsequently be taken. This makes it difficult to quantify human intentions.
To solve this problem, we apply competitive learning to human behavior prediction as supervised learning. In our approach, competitive learning generates several outputs that are then associated with several potential situations imagined by a human. We applied the proposed method to human driving behavior and extracted three potential driving patterns. Results showed a squared error is reduced to 1/25 that of a conventional method . We also found that competitive learning can distinguish valid data from disturbance data in order to train a model."
Conditional Image Synthesis With Auxiliary Classifier GANs,"Synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images has been a long-standing challenge in machine learning. In this paper we introduce new methods for the improved training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis. We construct a variant of GANs employing label conditioning that results in 128x128 resolution image samples exhibiting global coherence. We expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, 128x128 samples are more than twice as discriminable as artificially resized 32x32 samples. In addition, 84.7% of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data."
Multi-label learning with semantic embeddings,"Multi-label learning aims to automatically assign to an instance (e.g., an image or a document) the most relevant subset of labels from a large set of possible labels. The main challenge is to maintain accurate predictions while scaling efficiently on data sets with extremely large label sets and many training data points. We propose a simple but effective neural net approach, the Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), that models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. A Gauss-Siedel mini-batch adaptive gradient descent algorithm is used to fit the model. To handle extremely large label sets, we propose and experimentally validate the efficacy of fitting randomly chosen marginal label distributions. Experimental results on eight real-world data sets show that SEM garners significant performance gains over existing methods. In particular, we compare SEM to four recent state-of-the-art algorithms (NNML, BMLPL, REmbed, and SLEEC) and find that SEM uniformly outperforms these algorithms in several widely used evaluation metrics while requiring significantly less training time.

Significance of Softmax-Based Features over Metric Learning-Based Features,"The extraction of useful deep features is important for many computer vision tasks.
Deep features extracted from classification networks have proved to perform well in those tasks.
To obtain features of greater usefulness, end-to-end distance metric learning (DML) has been applied to train the feature extractor directly.
End-to-end DML approaches such as Magnet Loss and lifted structured feature embedding show state-of-the-art performance in several image recognition tasks.
However, in these DML studies, there were no equitable comparisons between features extracted from a DML-based network and those from a softmax-based network.
In this paper, by presenting objective comparisons between these two approaches under the same network architecture, we show that the softmax-based features are markedly better than the state-of-the-art DML features for tasks such as fine-grained recognition, attribute estimation, clustering, and retrieval."
Improving Sampling from Generative Autoencoders with Markov Chains,"We focus on generative autoencoders, such as variational or adversarial autoencoders, which jointly learn a generative model alongside an inference model. We define generative autoencoders as autoencoders which are trained to softly enforce a prior on the latent distribution learned by the model. However, the model does not necessarily learn to match the prior. We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively encoding and decoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Using this we can improve the quality of samples drawn from the model, especially when the learned distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we also reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without the denoising criterion."
Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks,"Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long- standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network, that can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. We show some evidence that the proposed model can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences without using explicit boundary information. We evaluate our proposed model on character-level language modelling and handwriting sequence generation."
Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks,"We present the Neural Photo Editor, an interface for exploring the latent space of generative image models and making large, semantically coherent changes to existing images. Our interface is powered by the Introspective Adversarial Network, a hybridization of the Generative Adversarial Network and the Variational Autoencoder designed for use in the editor. Our model makes use of a novel computational block based on dilated convolutions, and Orthogonal Regularization, a novel weight regularization method. We validate our model on CelebA, SVHN, and ImageNet, and produce samples and reconstructions with high visual fidelity."
Learning Graphical State Transitions,"Graph-structured data is important in modeling relationships between multiple entities, and can be used to represent states of the world as well as many data structures. Li et al. (2016) describe a model known as a Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network (GGS-NN) that can transform graph-structured inputs into output sequences. In this work I introduce a set of graph-based transformations, which I combine to construct a versatile extension of GGS-NNs that uses graph-structured data as an intermediate representation. The model can learn to construct and modify graphs in sophisticated ways based on textual input, and also to use the graphs to produce a variety of outputs. For example, the model successfully learns to solve almost all of the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2016), and also discovers the rules governing graphical formulations of a simple cellular automaton and a family of Turing machines.

Dropout with Expectation-linear Regularization,"Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical investigations. However, the gap between dropout’s training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce (approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard dropout training objective, resulting in an explicit control of the gap. Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently."
HyperNetworks,"This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network. Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in nature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a phenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers. Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer learnable parameters."
A Learned Representation For Artistic Style,"The diversity of painting styles represents a rich visual vocabulary for the construction of an image. The degree to which one may learn and parsimoniously capture this visual vocabulary measures our understanding of the higher level features of paintings, if not images in general. In this work we investigate the construction of a single, scalable deep network that can parsimoniously capture the artistic style of a diversity of paintings. We demonstrate that such a network generalizes across a diversity of artistic styles by reducing a painting to a point in an embedding space. Importantly, this model permits a user to explore new painting styles by arbitrarily combining the styles learned from individual paintings. We hope that this work provides a useful step towards building rich models of paintings and offers a window on to the structure of the learned representation of artistic style."
Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography,"We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect
information from other neural networks.  Specifically, we focus on
ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we
specify those properties in terms of an adversary.  Thus, a
system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim
to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from
eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob.
We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks;
instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially.
We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn 
how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also
how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet
confidentiality goals.

Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting,"Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the
best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited
for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts
have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying
unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and training methods.
In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised training
of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial regions
within images.  This criterion can be employed within conventional neural net-
works and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and back-propagation,
thus complementing supervised methods."
Charged Point Normalization: An Efficient Solution to the Saddle Point Problem,"Recently, the problem of local minima in very high dimensional non-convex optimization has been challenged and the problem of saddle points has been introduced. This paper introduces a dynamic type of normalization that forces the system to escape saddle points. Unlike other saddle point escaping algorithms, second order information is not utilized, and the system can be trained with an arbitrary gradient descent learner. The system drastically improves learning in a range of deep neural networks on various data-sets in comparison to non-CPN neural networks."
SoftTarget Regularization: An Effective Technique to Reduce Over-Fitting in Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks are learning models with a very high capacity and therefore prone to over-fitting. Many regularization techniques such as Dropout, DropConnect, and weight decay all attempt to solve the problem of over-fitting by reducing the capacity of their respective models (Srivastava et al., 2014), (Wan et al., 2013), (Krogh & Hertz, 1992). In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures."
Surprisal-Driven Feedback in Recurrent Networks,"Recurrent neural nets are widely used for predicting temporal data. Their inherent deep feedforward structure allows learning complex sequential patterns. It is believed that top-down feedback might be an important missing ingredient which in theory could help disambiguate similar patterns depending on broader context. In this paper, we introduce surprisal-driven recurrent networks, which take into account past error information when making new predictions. This is achieved by continuously monitoring the discrepancy between most recent predictions and the actual observations. Furthermore, we show that it outperforms other stochastic and fully deterministic approaches on enwik8 character level prediction task achieving 1.37 BPC."
Hadamard Product for Low-rank Bilinear Pooling,"Bilinear models provide rich representations compared with linear models. They have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition, segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However, bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear pooling using Hadamard product for an efficient attention mechanism of multimodal learning. We show that our model outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks with the state-of-the-art results on the VQA dataset, having a better parsimonious property."
